<h2>Introduction.</h2>

<p>The section of the Pennsylvania Railroad Tunnel work described
in this paper is that lying between Tenth Avenue, New York City,
and the large shaft built by the Company at Weehawken, N. J., and
thus comprises the crossing of the North or Hudson River, the barrier
which has stood for such a long time between the railroads and their
possession of terminal stations in New York City. The general plan
and section, <a href="#PLATE_XXVIII">Plate XXVIII</a>, shows the work included.</p>

<p>This paper is written from the point of view of those engaged by
the Chief Engineer of the Railroad Company to look after the work
of construction in the field. The history of the undertaking is not
included, the various phases through which many of the designs and
plans passed are not followed, nor are the considerations regarding
foundations under the subaqueous portions of the tunnels and the
various tests made in connection with this subject set out, as all
these matters will be found in other papers on these tunnels.</p>

<p>This paper only aims to describe, as briefly as possible, the actual
designs which were finally adopted, the actual conditions met on the
ground, and the methods of construction adopted by the contractors.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span></p>

<p>For easy reference, and to keep the descriptions of work of a
similar character together, the subject will be treated under the four
main headings, viz.: Shafts, Plant, Land Tunnels, and River Tunnels.</p>

<h2>Shafts.</h2>

<p>It is not intended to give much length to the description of the
Shafts or the Land Tunnels, as more interest will probably center in
the River Tunnels.</p>

<p>The shafts did not form part of the regular tunnel contract, but
were built under contract by the United Engineering and Contracting
Company while the contract plans for the tunnel were being prepared.
In this way, when the tunnel contracts were let, the contractor found
the shafts ready, and he could get at his work at once.</p>

<p>Two shafts were provided, one on the New York side and one on the New
Jersey side. Their exact situation is shown on <a href="#PLATE_XXVIII">Plate XXVIII</a>. They were
placed as near as possible to the point at which the disappearance of
the rock from the tunnels made it necessary to start the shield-driven
portion of the work.</p>

<p>The details of the shafts will now be described briefly.</p>

<p><i>The Manhattan Shaft.</i>&mdash;The Manhattan Shaft is located about 100
ft. north of the tunnel center; there was nothing noticeable about its
construction. General figures relating to both shafts are given in
<a href="#TABLE_1">Table 1.</a></p>

<p><i>The Weehawken Shaft.</i>&mdash;The Weehawken Shaft is shown in <a href="#Fig_1">Fig. 1</a>.
This, as will be seen from <a href="#TABLE_1">Table 1</a>, was a comparatively large piece of
work. The shaft is over the tunnels, and includes both of them. In
the original design the wall of the shaft was intended to follow in
plan the property line shown in <a href="#Fig_2">Fig. 2</a>, and merely to extend down to
the surface of the rock, which, as disclosed by the preliminary borings,
was here about 15 ft. below the surface. However, as the excavation
proceeded, it was found that this plan would not do, as the depth to
the rock surface varied greatly, and was often much lower than
expected; the rock itself, moreover, was very treacherous, the cause
being that the line of junction between the triassic sandstone, which
is here the country rock, and the intrusive trap of the Bergen Hill ridge,
occurs about one-third of the length of the shaft from its western end,
causing more or less disintegration of both kinds of rock. Therefore it
was decided to line the shaft with concrete throughout its entire depth,
the shape being changed to a rectangular plan, as shown in the drawings.
At the same time that the shaft was excavated, a length of 40 ft. of
tunnels at each end of it was taken out, also on account of the treacherous
nature of the ground, thus avoiding risk of injury to the shaft when
the tunnel contractors commenced work. There was much trouble with
floods during the fall of 1903, and numerous heavy falls of ground occurred,
in spite of extreme care and much heavy timbering. The greatest
care was also taken in placing the concrete lining, and the framing to
support the forms was carefully designed and of heavy construction;
the forms were of first-class workmanship, and great care was taken to
keep them true to line. A smooth surface was given to the concrete
by placing a 3-in. layer of mortar at the front of the walls and tamping
this dry facing mixture well down with the rest of the concrete. The
east and west walls act as retaining walls, while those on the north
and south are facing walls, and are tied to the rock with steel rods
embedded and grouted into the rock and into the concrete. Ample
drainage for water at the back of the wall was provided by upright,
open-joint, vitrified drains at frequent intervals, with dry-laid stone
drains leading to them from all wet spots in the ground. A general
view of the finished work is shown in <a href="#Fig_1">Fig. 1</a>,
<a href="#PLATE_XXIX_Fig_1">Plate XXIX</a>, and
<a href="#TABLE_1">Table 1</a> gives the most important dates and figures
relating to this shaft.</p>

<p>After the tunnel work was finished, both shafts were provided with
stairs leading to the surface, a protective head-house was placed over
the New York Shaft, and a reinforced concrete fence, 8 ft. high, was
built around the Weehawken Shaft on the Company's property line,
that is, following the outline of the shaft as originally designed.</p>

<h2>Plant.</h2>

<h3>Working Sites.</h3>

<p>Before beginning a description of the tunnel work, it may be well
to set out in some detail the arrangements made on the surface for
conducting the work underground.</p>

<p>All the work was carried on from two shafts, one at Eleventh Avenue and
32d Street, New York City&mdash;called the Manhattan Shaft&mdash;and one at
Baldwin Avenue, Weehawken, N. J.&mdash;called the Weehawken Shaft.

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span></p>

<p>The characteristics of the two sites were radically different, and
called for different methods of handling the transportation problem.
The shaft site at Manhattan is shown on <a href="#PLATE_XXX">Plate XXX</a>. It will
be seen that there was not much room, in fact, the site was too
cramped for comfort; the total area, including the space occupied by
the old foundry, used for power-houses, offices, etc., was about 3,250
sq. yd. This made it necessary to have two stages, one on the ground
level for handling materials into the yard, and an overhead gantry on
which the excavated materials were handled off the premises. The
yard at Weehawken was much larger; it is also shown on <a href="#PLATE_XXX">Plate
XXX</a>. Its area was about 15,400 sq. yd. in the yard proper, and
there was an additional space of about 750 sq. yd. alongside the wharf
at the "North Slip," on the river front, connected with the main
portion of the yard by an overhead trestle.</p>

<p>All the cars at Manhattan were moved by hand, but at Weehawken
two electric locomotives with overhead transmission were used.</p>

<h3>Power-House Plant.</h3>

<p>At the Manhattan Shaft the power-house plant was installed on
the ground floor of the old foundry building which occupied the north
side of the leased area. This was a brick building, quite old, and in
rather a tumble-down condition when the Company took possession,
and in consequence it required quite a good deal of repair and
strengthening work. The first floor of the building was used by the
contractor as offices, men's quarters, doctor's offices, and so on, and
on the next one above, which was the top floor, were the offices occupied
by the Railroad Company's field engineering staff.</p>

<p>On the Weehawken side, the plant was housed in a wooden-frame,
single-story structure, covered with corrugated iron. It was rectangular
in plan, measuring 80 by 130 ft.</p>

<p>At both sides of the river the engines were bedded on solid concrete
on a rock foundation.</p>

<p>The installation of the plant on the Manhattan side occupied from
May, 1904, to April, 1905, and on the Weehawken side from September,
1904, to April, 1905. Air pressure was on the tunnels at the New
York side on June 25th, 1905, and on the Weehawken side on the
29th of the same month.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span></p>

<p>The plants contained in the two power-houses were almost identical,
there being only slight differences in the details of arrangement
due to local conditions. A list of the main items of the plant at
one power-house is shown in <a href="#TABLE_2">Table 2</a>.</p>

<p>The following is a short description of each item of plant in
<a href="#TABLE_2">Table 2</a>:</p>

<p><i>Boilers.</i>&mdash;At each shaft there were three 500-h.p., water-tube
boilers, Class F (made by Sterling and Company, Chicago, Ill.). They
had independent steel stacks, 54 in. in diameter and 100 ft. above grate
level; each had 5,000 sq. ft. of heating surface and 116 sq. ft. of grate
area. The firing was by hand, and there were shaking grates and
four doors to each furnace. Under normal conditions of work, two
boilers at each plant were able to supply all the steam required. The
average working pressure of the steam was 135 lb. per sq. in.</p>

<p>The steam piping system was on the loop or by-pass plan. The
diameter of the pipes varied from 14 in. in the main header to 10 in.
in the body of the loop. The diameter of the exhaust steam main
increased from 8 in. at the remote machines to 20 in., and then to
30 in., at the steam separator, which in turn was connected with the
condensers. A pipe with an automatic relief valve from the exhaust
to the atmosphere was used when the condensers were shut down. All
piping was of the standard, flanged extra-heavy type, with bronze-seated
gate-valves on the principal lines, and globe-valves on some of
the auxiliary ones. There was an 8-in. water leg on the main header
fitted with a Mason-Kelly trap, and other smaller water traps were
set at suitable intervals.</p>

<p>Each boiler was fitted with safety valves, and there were automatic
release valves on the high-and low-pressure cylinders of each compressor,
as well as on each air receiver.</p>

<p>Buckwheat coal was used, and was delivered to the bins on the
Manhattan side by teams and on the Weehawken side by railroad cars
or in barges, whence it was taken to the power-house by 2-ft. gauge
cars. An average of 20 tons of coal in each 24 hours was used by
each plant.</p>

<p>The water was taken directly from the public service supply main.
The daily quantity used was approximately 4,000 gal. for boiler purposes
and 4,400 gal. for general plant use. Wooden overhead tanks
having a capacity of 14,000 gal. at each plant served as a 12-hour
emergency supply.</p>

<p><i>Feed Pumps.</i>&mdash;There were two feed pumps at each plant. They
had a capacity of 700 cu. ft. per min., free discharge. The plungers
were double, of 6-in. diameter, and 10-in. stroke, the steam cylinders
were of 10-in. diameter and 10-in. stroke. An injector of the "Metropolitan
Double-Tube" type, with a capacity of 700 cu. ft. per min.,
was fitted to each boiler for use in emergencies.</p>

<p>The feed-water heater was a "No. 9 Cochrane," guaranteed to heat
45,000 lb. of water per hour, and had a total capacity of 85.7 cu. ft.
It was heated by the exhaust steam from the non-condensing auxiliary
plant.</p>

<p><i>Condenser Plant.</i>&mdash;There were two surface condensers at each
plant. Each had a cooling surface sufficient to condense 22,500 lb. of
steam per hour, with water at a temperature of 70&deg; Fahr. and
barometer at 30 in., maintaining a vacuum of 26 in. in the condenser.
Each was fitted with a Blake, horizontal, direct-acting, vacuum pump.</p>

<p><i>Circulating-Water Pumps.</i>&mdash;Two circulating-water pumps, supplying
salt water directly from the Hudson River, were placed on the
wharf. They were 8-in. centrifugal pumps, each driven by a 36-h.p.,
General Electric Company's direct-current motor (220 volts and 610
rev. per min.), the current being supplied from the contractor's power-house
generators. The pumps were run alternately 24 hours each at a
time. Those on the Manhattan side were 1,300 ft. from the power-house,
and delivered their water through a 16-in. pipe; those on
the Weehawken side were 450 ft. away, and delivered through a 14-in.
pipe. There was also a direct connection with the city mains, in case
of an accident to the salt-water pumps.

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Low-Pressure Compressors.</i>&mdash;At each plant there were three
low-pressure compressors. These were for the supply of compressed air to
the working chambers of the subaqueous shield-driven tunnels. They were
also used on occasions to supply compressed air to the cylinders of the
high-pressure compressors, thus largely increasing the capacity of the
latter when hard pressed by an unusual call on account of heavy drilling
work in the rock tunnels. They were of a new design, of duplex Corliss
type, having cross-compound steam cylinders, designed to operate
condensing, but capable of working non-condensing; the air cylinders
were simple duplex. The steam cylinder valves were of the Corliss
release type, with vacuum dash-pots. The valves in the air cylinders
were mechanically-operated piston valves, with end inlet and discharge.
The engines used steam at 135 lb. pressure. The high-and low-pressure
steam cylinders were 14 in. and 30 in. in diameter, respectively, with a
stroke of 36 in. and a maximum speed of 135 rev. per min. The two air
cylinders were 23&frac12; in. in diameter, and had a combined capacity of
35.1 cu. ft. of free air per revolution, and, when running at 125 rev.
per min., each machine had an actual capacity of 4,389 cu. ft. of free
air per min., or 263,340 cu. ft. per hour. The air cylinders were
covered by water-jackets through which salt water from the circulating
pumps flowed. A gauge pressure of 50 lb. of air could be obtained.</p>

<p>Each compressor was fitted with an automatic speed and air-pressure
regulator, designed to vary the cut-off according to the
volume of air required, and was provided with an after-cooler fitted
with tinned-brass tube and eight Tobin-bronze tube-plates having
809 sq. ft. of cooling surface; each one was capable of reducing the
temperature of the air delivered by it to within 10&deg; Fahr. of the
temperature of the cooling water when its compressor was operated
at its fullest capacity. From the after-cooler the air passed into a
vertical receiver, 4 ft. 6 in. in diameter and 12 ft. high, there being
one such receiver for each compressor. The receivers were tested to
a pressure of 100 lb. per sq. in. The after-coolers were provided with
traps to collect precipitated moisture and oil. The coolers and
receivers were fitted with safety valves set to blow off at 1 lb. above
the working pressure. The air supply was taken from without, and
above the power-house roof, but in very cold weather it could be taken
from within doors.</p>

<p><i>High-Pressure Compressors.</i>&mdash;There was one high-pressure compressor
at each plant. Each consisted of two duplex air cylinders
fitted to a cross-compound, Corliss-Bass, steam engine. The two steam
cylinders were 14 and 26 in. in diameter, respectively, and the air
cylinders were 14&frac14; in. in diameter and had a 36-in. stroke. The air
cylinder was water-jacketed with salt water supplied from the circulating
water pumps.</p>

<p>The capacity was about 1,100 cu. ft. of free air per min. when
running at 85 rev. per min. and using intake air at normal pressure,
but, when receiving air from the low-pressure compressors at a
pressure of 30 lb. per sq. in., the capacity was 3,305 cu. ft. of free air
per min.; receiving air at 50 lb. per sq. in., the capacity would have
been 4,847 cu. ft. of free air per min. This latter arrangement,
however, called for more air than the low-pressure compressors could
deliver. With the low-pressure compressor running at 125 rev. per
min. (its maximum speed), it could furnish enough air at 43.8 lb.
per sq. in. to supply the high-pressure compressor running at 85 rev.
per min. (its maximum speed); and, with the high-pressure compressor
delivering compressed air at 150 lb., the combined capacity of the
arrangement would have been 4,389 cu. ft. of free air per min.</p>

<p>The air passed through a receiver, 4 ft. 6 in. in diameter and 12 ft.
high, tested under a water pressure of 225 lb. per sq. in., before being
sent through the distributing pipes.</p>

<p><i>Hydraulic Power Pumps.</i>&mdash;At each power-house there were three
hydraulic power pumps to operate the tunneling shields. One pump
was used for each tunnel, leaving the third as a stand-by. The
duplex steam cylinders were 15 in. in diameter, with a 10-in. stroke;
the duplex water rams were 2&#8539; in. in diameter with a 10-in. stroke.
The pumps were designed to work up to 6,000 lb. per sq. in., but the
usual working pressure was about 4,500 lb. The piping, which was
extra heavy hydraulic, was connected by heavy cast-steel screw coup

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>lings

having a hexagonal cross-section in the middle to enable tightening
to be done with a bolt wrench. The piping was designed to withstand
a pressure of 5,500 lb. per sq. in.</p>

<p><i>Electric Generators.</i>&mdash;At each plant there were two electric generators
supplying direct current for both lighting and power, at 240
volts, through a two-wire system of mains. They were of Type M-P,
Class 6, 100 kw., 400 amperes, 250 rev. per min., 240 volts no load and
250 volts full load. They were connected direct to 10 by 20 by 14-in.,
center-crank, tandem-compound, engines of 150 h.p. at 250 rev. per
min. A switch-board, with all the necessary fuses, switches, and
meters, was provided at each plant.</p>

<p><i>Lubrication.</i>&mdash;In the lubricating system three distinct systems
were used, each requiring its own special grade of oil.</p>

<p>The journals and bearings were lubricated with ordinary engine
oil by a gravity system; the oil after use passed through a "White
Star" filter, and was pumped into a tank about 15 ft. above the engine-room
floor.</p>

<p>The low-pressure air cylinders were lubricated with "High Test"
oil, having a flash point of 600&deg; Fahr. The oil was forced from a
receiving tank into an elevated tank by high-pressure air. When the
tank was full the high-pressure air was turned off and the low-pressure
air was turned on, in this way the air pressure in the oil tank equalled
that in the air cylinder being lubricated, thus allowing a perfect
gravity system to exist.</p>

<p>The steam cylinders and the high-pressure air cylinders were fed
with oil from hand-fed automatic lubricators made by the Detroit
Lubrication Company, Detroit, Mich.</p>

<p>"Steam Cylinder" oil was used for the steam cylinders and "High
Test" oil (the same as used for the low-pressure air cylinders) for
the high-pressure air cylinders. The air cylinder and steam cylinder
lubricators were of the same kind, except that no condensers were
necessary. The steam cylinder and engine oil was caught on drip
pans, and, after being filtered, was used again as engine oil in the
bearings. The oil from the air cylinders was not saved, nor was that
from the steam cylinders caught at the separator.</p>

<p><i>Cost of Operating the Power-House Plants.</i>&mdash;In order to give an
idea of the general cost of running these plants,
<a href="#TABLE_3">Tables 3</a> and <a href="#TABLE_4">4</a> are
given as typical of the force employed and the general supplies needed

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>

for a 24-hour run of one plant. <a href="#TABLE_3">Table 3</a> gives a typical run during
the period of driving the shields, and <a href="#TABLE_4">Table 4</a> is typical of the period
of concrete construction. In the latter case the tunnels were under
normal air pressure. Before the junction of the shields, both plants
were running continuously; after the junction, but while the tunnels
were still under compressed air, only one power-house plant was
operated.</p>

<p><i>Stone-Crusher Plant.</i>&mdash;A short description of the stone-crusher
plant will be given, as it played an important part in the economy of
the concrete work. In order to provide crushed stone for the concrete,
the contractor bought (from the contractor who built the Bergen Hill
Tunnels) the pile of trap rock excavated from these tunnels, which
had been dumped on the piece of waste ground to the north of Baldwin
Avenue, Weehawken, N. J.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span></p>

<p>The general layout of the plant is shown on <a href="#PLATE_XXX">Plate XXX</a>. It
consisted of a No. 6 and a No. 8 Austin crusher, driven by an Amex,
single-cylinder, horizontal, steam engine of 120 h.p., and was capable
of crushing about 225 cu. yd. of stone per 10-hour day. The crushers
and conveyors were driven from a countershaft, in turn driven from
the engine by an 18-in. belt.</p>

<p>The process of crushing was as follows: The stone from the pile
was loaded by hand into scale-boxes which were lifted by two derricks
into the chute above the No. 6 crusher. One derrick had a 34-ft. mast
and a 56-ft. boom, and was worked by a Lidgerwood steam hoister; the
other had a 23-ft. mast and a 45-ft. boom, and was worked by a
"General Electric" hoist. All the stone passed first through the
No. 6 crusher, after which it was lifted by a bucket conveyor to a
screen, placed about 60 ft. higher than and above the stone bin. The
screen was a steel chute pierced by 2&frac12;-in. circular holes, and was on
a slope of about 45&deg;; in order to prevent the screen from choking, it

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>

was necessary to have two men continually scraping the stone over
it with hoes. All the stone passing the screen was discharged into a
bin below with a capacity of about 220 cu. yd. The stone not passing
the screen passed down a diagonal chute to a No. 8 crusher, from
which, after crushing, it was carried back by a second bucket conveyor
to the bin, into which it was dumped without passing a screen.
The No. 8 crusher was arranged so that it could, when necessary,
receive stone direct from the stone pile. The cars in which the stone
was removed could be run under the bin and filled by opening a sliding
door in the bottom of the bin. A track was laid from the bin to
connect with the contractor's surface railway in the Weehawken
Shaft yard, and on this track the stone could be transported either
to the Weehawken Shaft direct, for use on that side of the river, or
to the wharf, where it could be dumped into scows for transportation to
New York.</p>

<p>The cars used were 3-cu. yd. side-dump, with flap-doors, and were
hauled by two steam Dinky locomotives.</p>

<p>The average force employed was:</p>

<p>The tunneling shields, however, will be described now, as much of
the explanation of the shield-driven work will not be clear unless
preceded by a good idea of their design.</p>

<h3>Tunneling Shields.</h3>

<p>During the period in which the original contract drawings were
being made, namely, in the latter part of 1903 and the early part of
1904, considerable attention was given to working out detailed studies
for a type of shield which would be suitable for dealing with the
various kinds of ground through which the shield-driven tunnels had
to pass. This was done in order that, when the contract was let, the
engineer's ideas of the requirements of the shields should be thoroughly
crystallized, and so that the contractor might take advantage of this
long-thought-out design, instead of being under the necessity of
placing a hurried order for a piece of plant on which so much of the
safety as well as of the speed of his work depended. Eventually, the
contractor took over these designs as they stood, with certain minor
modifications, and the shields as built and worked gave entire satisfaction.
The chief points held in view were ample strength, easy access
to the working face combined with ease and quickness of closing the
diaphragm, and general simplicity. A clear idea of the main features
of the design can be gathered from <a href="#Fig_3">Fig. 3</a> and
<a href="#PLATE_XXXI">Plate XXXI</a>.</p>

The interior diameter of the skin was 2 in. greater than the external
diameter of the metal lining of the tunnel, which was 23 ft. The skin
was made up of three thicknesses of steel plate, a &frac34;-in. plate outside
and inside, with a &#8541;-in. plate between; thus the external diameter of
the skin was 23 ft. 6&frac14; in. The length over all (exclusive of the hood,
to be described later) was 15 ft. 11-7/16 in. The maximum overlap of the
skin over the erected metal lining was 6 ft. 4&frac12; in., and the minimum
overlap, 2 ft.</p>

<p>There were no inside or outside cover-plates, the joints of the
various pieces of skin plates being butt-joints covered by the overlap
of adjoining plates. All riveting was flush, both inside and outside.
The whole circumference of each skin plate was made up of eight
pieces, each of which extended the entire length of the shield, the only
circumferential joint on the outside being at the junction of the
removable cutting edge (or of the hood when the latter was in position)
with the shield proper.</p>

<p>Forward of the back ends of the jacks, the shield was stiffened by
an annular girder supporting the skin, and in the space between the
stiffeners of which were set the 24 propelling rams used to shove the
shield ahead by pressure exerted on the last erected ring of metal
lining, as shown on <a href="#PLATE_XXXI">Plate XXXI</a>.</p>

<p>To assist in taking the thrust of these rams, gusset-plates were
placed against the end of each ram cylinder, and were carried forward
to form level brackets supporting the cast-steel cutting-edge segments.
The stiffening gussets, between which were placed the rams, were also
carried forward as level brackets, for the same purpose. The cast-steel
segmental cutting edge was attached to the front of the last
mentioned plates.</p>

<p>The interior structural framing consisted of two floors and three
vertical partitions, giving nine openings or pockets for access to the
face; these pockets were 2 ft. 7 in. wide, the height varying from 2 ft.
2 in. to 3 ft. 4 in., according to their location. The openings were
provided with pivoted segmental doors, which were adopted because
they could be shut without having to displace any ground which might
be flowing into the tunnel, and while open their own weight tended
to close them, being held from doing so by a simple catch.</p>

<p>For passing through the varied assortment of ground before entering
on the true sub-river silt, it was decided to adopt the forward
detachable extension, or hood, which has so often proved its worth in
ground needing timber for its support, as shown in
<a href="#PLATE_XXIX_Fig_2">Fig. 2, Plate XXIX</a>.
This hood extended 2 ft. 1 in. beyond the cutting edge,
and from the top down to the level of the upper platform. Additional
pieces were provided by which the hood might have been brought down
as far as the lower platform, but they were not used. Special trapezoidal
steel castings formed the junction between the hood and the
cutting edge. The hood was in nine sections, built up of two &frac34;-in. and
one &#8541;-in. skin plates, as in the main body of the skin, and was supported
by bracket plates attached to the forward ends of the ram
chambers. The hoods were bolted in place, and were removed and
replaced by regular cutting-edge steel castings after the shields had
passed the river lines.</p>

<p>The floors of the two platforms, of which there were eight, formed
by the division of the platforms by the upright framing, could be
extended forward 2 ft. 9 in. in front of the cutting edge, or 8 in. in
front of the hood. This motion was given by hydraulic jacks. The
sliding platform could hold a load of 7,900 lb. per sq. ft., which was
equal to the maximum head of ground and water combined. The
uses of these platforms will be described under the heading "Construction."
The weight of the structural portion of each shield was
about 135 tons.</p>

<p>The remainder of the shield was the hydraulic part, which provided
its motive force and gave the power to the segment erector.
The hydraulic fittings weighed about 58 tons per shield, so that the
total weight of each shield was about 193 tons. The hydraulic apparatus
was designed for a maximum pressure of 5,000 lb. per sq. in., a
minimum pressure of 2,000 lb., and a test pressure of 6,000 lb. The
actual average pressure used was about 3,500 lb. per sq. in.</p>

<p>There were 24 shoving rams, with a diameter of 8&frac12; in. and stroke
of 38 in. The main ram was single-acting. The packings could be
tightened up from the outside without removing the ram, a thing
which is of the greatest convenience, and cannot be done with the
differential plunger type. Some of the chief figures relating to the
shield rams, with a water pressure of 5,000 lb. per sq. in., are:

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span></p>

      <td class="number">480 lb. per sq. in.</td>
    </tr>

<p>The rams developed a tendency to bend, under the severe test of
shoving the shield all closed, or nearly so, through the river silt, and
it is probable that it would have been better to make the pistons
10 in. in diameter instead of 8&frac12; in.</p>

<p>Each sliding platform was actuated by two single-acting rams,
3&frac12; in. in diameter and having a stroke of 2 ft. 9 in. The rams were
attached to the rear face of the shield diaphragm inside the box floors,
and the cylinders were movable, sliding freely on bearings in the floor.
The front ends of the cylinders were fixed to the front ends of the
sliding platforms. The cylinder thus supported the front end of the
sliding platform, and was designed to carry its half of the load on the
platform. Some of the leading figures in connection with the platform
rams, at a working pressure of 5,000 lb. per sq. in., are:</p>

      <td class="number">13,040 lb.</td>
    </tr>
</table>

<p>Each shield was fitted with a single erector mounted on the rear
of the diaphragm. The erector consisted of a box-shaped frame
mounted on a central shaft revolving on bearings attached to the
shield. Inside of this frame there was a differential hydraulic plunger,
4 in. and 3 in. in diameter and of 48-in. stroke. To the plunger head
were attached two channels sliding inside the box frame, and to the
projecting ends of these the grip was attached. At the opposite end
of the box frame a counterweight was attached which balanced about
700 lb. of the tunnel segment at 11 ft. radius.

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span></p>

<p>The erector was revolved by two single-acting rams fixed horizontally
to the back of the shield above the erector pivot through
double chains and chain wheels keyed to the erector shaft.</p>

<p>The principal figures connected with the erector, assuming a water

<p>When the shield was designed, a grip was also designed by which
the erector could handle segments without any special lugs being cast
on them. A bolt was passed through two opposite bolt holes in the
circumferential flanges of a plate. The grip jaws closed over this bolt
and locked themselves. The projecting fixed ends of the grip were for
taking the direct thrust on the grip caused by the erector ram when
placing a segment.</p>

<p>It happened, however, that there was delay in delivering these grips,
and, when the shield was ready to start, and the grip was not forthcoming,
Mr. Patrick Fitzgerald, the Contractor's Superintendent, overcame
this trouble by having another grip made.</p>

<p>In this design, also, a self-catching bolt is placed through the
segment and the grip catches the bolt. In simplicity and effectiveness
in working, this new design eventually proved a decided advance on
the original one, and, as a result, all the shields were fitted with the
new grip, and the original design was discarded.</p>

<p>The great drawback to the original grip was that the plate swung
on the lifting bolt, and thus brought a great strain on the bolt when

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>

held rigidly at right angles to the erector arm. The original design
was able to handle both <i>A</i>and <i>B</i>segments, and key segments, without
alteration; in the new design, an auxiliary head had to be swung into
position to handle the key, but this objection did not amount to a
practical drawback.</p>

<p>The operating floor from which the shield was controlled, and at
which the valves were situated, was placed above the rams which
rotate the erector, and formed a protection for them. The control of
the shield rams was divided into four groups: the seven lower rams
constituted one group, the upper five, another, and the six remaining
on each side, the other two. Each group was controlled by its own
stop and release valve. Individual rams were controlled by stop-cocks.</p>

<p>The control of the sliding platform rams was divided into two
groups, of which all the rams on the upper floor made one, and all
those in the lower floor, the other; here, again, each group had its own
stop and release valve, and individual platforms were controlled by
stop-cocks arranged in blocks from which the pipes were carried to
the rams.</p>

<p>The in-and-out movements of the erector ram were controlled by a
two-spindle, balanced, stop and release valve, controlled by a hand-wheel.
The erector rotating rams were controlled by a similar valve,
with four spindles, also operated by a single hand-wheel. Both
wheels were placed inside the top shield pockets, and within easy reach
of the operating platform.</p>

<p>The hydraulic pressure was brought through the tunnel by a 2-in.
hydraulic pipe. Connection with the shield was made by a flexible
copper pipe, the 2-in. line being extended as the shield advanced.</p>

<h2>Land Tunnels.</h2>

<h3>General.</h3>

<p>The following is a brief account of the main features of the
"Land Tunnel" work, by which is meant all the part of the structure
built without using tunneling shields.</p>

<p>The Land Tunnels consist of about 977 ft. of double tunnel on the
New York side and 230 ft. on the New Jersey side, or a total of
1,207 lin. ft. of double tunnel.

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span></p>

<p>The general design of the cross-section consists of a semi-circular
arch, vertical side-walls and a flat invert. The tunnel is adapted for
two lines of track, each being contained in its compartment or tunnel.
The span of the arch is wider than is absolutely necessary to take the
rolling stock, and the extra space is utilized by the provision of a sidewalk
or "bench" forming by its upper surface a gangway, out of the
way of traffic, for persons walking in the tunnels, and embedded in its
mass are a number of vitrified earthenware ducts, for high-and low-tension
electric cables. The provision of this bench enables its vertical
wall to be brought much nearer to the side of the rolling stock than is
usually possible, thus minimizing the effects of a derailment or other
accident. Refuge niches for trackmen, and ladders to the top of the
bench are provided at frequent intervals. In cases where a narrow
street limits the width of the structure, as on the New York side, the
two tunnels are separated by a medial wall of masonry, thus involving
excavation over the entire width of both tunnels, and in such case the
tunnels are spoken of as "Twin Tunnels"; where the exigencies of
width are not so severe, the two tunnels are entirely distinct, and are
separated by a wall of rock. This type is found on the Weehawken
side. The arches are of brick, the remainder of the tunnel lining
being of concrete.</p>

<h3>New York Land Tunnels.</h3>

<p>The work on the Land Tunnels on the Manhattan side was carried
on from the shaft at 11th Avenue and 32d Street.

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span></p>

<p>The plans and designs for these tunnels are shown on <a href="#PLATE_XXXII">Plate
XXXII</a>. In this short length of about 977 ft. there are no less than
nine different kinds of cross-section. The reason for these changes
is the fact that the two lines of track are here not straight and parallel
to the center line between the tunnels, but are curved, although
symmetrical about this center line. The various changes of section
are to enable the tunnels to be built in straight lengths, thus avoiding
the disadvantages attending the use of curved forms, and at the same
time minimizing the quantity of excavation, an item which accounts
for from 60 to 70% of the total cost of tunnels of this type. Of
course, there are corresponding and obvious disadvantages in the
adoption of many short lengths of different cross-sections, and these
disadvantages were well brought out in the course of the work; on

the whole, however, they may be said to have justified their adoption.
These New York Land Tunnels were divided into three contracts, viz.:
From Station 190&nbsp;+&nbsp;15 (the Portal to the open work of the Terminal
Station at the east side of Tenth Avenue, New York City) to Station
197&nbsp;+&nbsp;60, called "Section Gy-East." The next contract, called
"Section Gy-West Supplementary," extended from Station 197&nbsp;+&nbsp;60
to Station 199&nbsp;+&nbsp;20, which is the east side of Eleventh Avenue.
The third contract was called "Section Gy-West," and extended from
Station 199&nbsp;+&nbsp;20 to Station 231&nbsp;+&nbsp;78 (the dividing line between the
States of New York and New Jersey). Thus, for nearly all its length,
this contract consists of shield-driven tunnel. The portion between
Stations 199&nbsp;+&nbsp;20 and 199&nbsp;+&nbsp;91.5, however, was of the Land Tunnel
type, and therefore will be included here. A fourth contract extended
from Station 231&nbsp;+&nbsp;78 to the Weehawken Shaft at Station 263&nbsp;+&nbsp;50,
and of this all but 230 ft. was of the shield-driven type, only the
portion next to the Weehawken Shaft being of the Land Tunnel type.</p>

<p>The four contracts were let to one contractor (The O'Rourke Engineering
Construction Company), and the work was carried on simultaneously
in all four, so that the division into contracts had no bearing
on the methods of work adopted, and these will now be described as a
whole and with no further reference to the different sections.</p>

<h3>Excavation.</h3>

<p>Work was started on the New York side on April 18th, 1904, the
Weehawken shaft being at that date still under construction. As will
have been noted in the description of the shafts, the contractor found
a shaft already prepared for his use, and cross-drifts at grade and at
right angles to the future tunnels, and extending across their entire
width. The first essential was to get access to the shield chambers,
which were to lie about 330 ft. to the west of the shaft, so that the
construction of these enlargements in which the shields for the subaqueous
tunnels were to be built might be finished as soon as possible
and thus allow the earliest possible start to be made with the shield-driven
tunnels.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span></p>

<p>With this in view, two bottom headings, on the center line of each
of the two tracks, were driven westward from the western cross-heading
at the foot of the shaft. When about 138 ft. had been made in this
way, the two headings were brought together and a break-up was made
to the crown level of the tunnel, as the depth of rock cover was doubtful.
From this break-up a top heading was driven westward to Station
200&nbsp;+&nbsp;30. While widening the heading out at Station 200&nbsp;+&nbsp;20
the rock was penetrated on the south side. The exposed wet sand
and gravel started to run, and, as a consequence, a change in design
was made, the shield chambers (and consequently the start of the
shield-driven tunnels) being moved eastward from their original location
133 ft. to their present location. A certain amount of time was
necessarily spent in making these changes of design, which involved
a rearrangement of the whole layout from the Terminal Station to the
start of the River Tunnels. On July 5th, 1904, however, the new
design was formally approved. No sooner had this been decided than
a strike arose on the work, and this was not settled until August 1st,
1904, but from that time the work progressed without delay. No
further reference will be made to the work in the shield chambers, as
that will come under the heading of "River Tunnels," being of the
segmental, cast-iron lined type.</p>

<p>A top heading was now driven over the original bottom heading
west of the shaft, and at the same time the original cross-drifts from
the shaft were amalgamated with and broken down by a heading driven
at the crown level of the "Intercepting Arch" which here cuts across
the ordinary run of tunnel at right angles and affords access to the
tunnels from the shafts.</p>

<p>The excavation of the upper portion of the intercepting arch at its
southern end gave some trouble, and caused some anxiety, as the rock
cover was penetrated and the wet sand and gravel were exposed. This
made it necessary to timber all this section heavily, and the tracks
of the New York Central Railroad directly above were successfully
supported. The general way in which this timbering was carried out
will be described under the head of "Timbering."

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span></p>

<p>Meanwhile, the excavation of the tunnels west of the intercepting
arch was continued until the North and South Tunnels were taken out
to their full outlines, leaving a core of rock between them. This core
was gradually removed, and timbering supporting the rock above the
middle wall was put in as excavation went on. The ground, which
was entirely of micaceous schist, typical of this part of Manhattan,
seamed with veins of granite, was rather heavy at the west end, or
adjacent to the shield chambers, and required complete segmental
timbering across the whole span. One heavy fall of rock in the corewall
between the North and South Tunnels took place on November
2d, but fortunately did not extend beyond the limits of the permanent
work. On November 7th, 1904, the excavation east of the intercepting
arch was begun by driving a bottom heading in the South Tunnel.
This was continued to Station 197&nbsp;+&nbsp;14 and then was taken up to the
crown level and worked as a top heading with the view of keeping
track, by making exploratory borings upward from the roof at frequent
intervals, of the rock surface, which was here irregular and not known
with any degree of certainty. The work was not pressed with any
vigor, because all efforts were then being bent toward excavating from
the River Tunnels as much rock as possible. In Section Gy-East the
conditions were exceptionally variable, as the rock was subject to
sudden changes from a soft crumbling mica schist to broad bands of
hard granite, and, in addition, the rock surface was very irregular,
and, for a good length of this section, was below the crown of the
tunnel, a condition which led to the adoption of the cut-and-cover
method for part of the work.</p>

<p>The irregularity in conditions called for varying methods of procedure,
but in general the methods were as shown on <a href="#PLATE_XXXIII">Plate XXXIII</a>,
and described as follows:</p>

<p><i>In Solid Rock.</i>&mdash;Where there was plenty of good rock cover, a top
middle heading was driven, which was afterward widened out to the
full cross-section of the twin tunnel arches. If necessary, a few
lengths of segmental timbering were put in before taking down the
bench, which was generally kept some 40 or 50 ft. behind the breast
of the heading. After the bench was down, the middle conduit trench
was excavated and the trimming done.</p>

<p><i>In Soft Rock.</i>&mdash;Where there was not enough rock cover, or where
there was actual soft ground in the roof, wall-plate headings at the
springing line level were driven ahead of the remainder of the work.
The wall-plates were laid in these, the roof was taken out in short
lengths, and segmental timbering spanning from wall-plate to wall-plate
was put in. The roof being thus held, the bench excavation
proceeded without trouble. Where the rock was penetrated and soft
ground showed in the roof, poling boards were driven ahead over the
crown-bars, as shown in <a href="#Fig_4">Fig. 4</a>.</p>

<p><i>Cut-and-Cover Work.</i>&mdash;After some 225 ft. had been driven from
the intercepting arch, it was found that the crown of the tunnel was
continually in soft ground. To ascertain the extent of this condition
the contractor decided to make soundings as far as Tenth Avenue,
which was done by sinking trial pits and making wash-borings in the
street. These soundings showed that there would be soft ground in
the crown from Station 194&nbsp;+&nbsp;75 to Station 194&nbsp;+&nbsp;25 (at one point
to a depth of 12 ft. below the crown), and on each side of this section
the cover was insufficient from Station 193&nbsp;+&nbsp;58 to Station 195&nbsp;+&nbsp;30.
This condition being known, it was decided to adopt cut-and-cover
work for this length, the principal reasons being that repairs to
sewers, streets, and drains would be no more, and probably less,
expensive than with the tunnel method; the underpinning of a heavy
brick brewery building adjoining the works on the north side would
be facilitated, and the opening in the street, through which muck and
materials could be handled, would relieve the congested shaft, through
which the large volume of muck from the River Tunnels was then
being conveyed. On the other hand, the cut-and-cover method was
adversely affected by the presence of a heavy timber trestle built down
the south side of the street and over which passed all the excavation
from the Terminal Station, amounting to a very heavy traffic. As
this trestle had to be supported, it complicated the situation considerably.
Very little active progress was made between June, 1905,
and April, 1906, as the contractor's energies during that time were much
taken up with the progress of the shield-driven tunnels. In April, 1906,
preparations were made to start a 50-ft. length of open cut, rangers
being fixed and sheathing driven; and the sewer which ran down the
middle of this street was diverted to the outside of the open-cut length.</p>

<p>April and May were occupied in driving the sheathing down to
rock, supporting the trestle, underpinning the adjoining brewery, and
excavating the soft material above the rock. On June 2d, 1906, rock
was reached, and, by July 31st, the excavation was down to subgrade
over nearly the whole 50 ft. in the first length. In the meantime
another length was opened up, and eventually a third.</p>

<p>The surface of the rock now seemed to be rising, and the heavy
buildings had been passed, so that tunneling was reverted to for the
rest of the work, though many difficulties were caused by soft rock
in the roof from time to time.</p>

<p>When the excavation for the open-cut work of the Terminal Station
had advanced to the line of Tenth Avenue, the contractor started a
heading from this point and drove westward under Tenth Avenue
until the headings driven eastward from the cut-and-cover portion,
were met.</p>

<p>This was done to expedite the work under Tenth Avenue, where
the ground was not very good, where there were several important gas
and water mains in the street, and where, moreover, the tunnels were
of exceptionally large span (24 ft. 6 in.), making a total width of
some 60 ft. for the excavation. The excavation for the New York
Tunnels was practically finished in January, 1908.</p>

<p><i>Drilling and Blasting.</i>&mdash;The foregoing short description will serve
to show in a general way the scheme adopted in making the excavation.
A few details on drilling and blasting methods may not be out of place.</p>

<p>Percussive drills run by air pressure were used. They were
Ingersoll-Sergeant, Nos. 3&frac12;, A-86, C-24, and F-24. The air came
from the high-pressure compressor previously described. This compressor,
without assistance, could supply air for nine drills, but, when
fed by compressed air from the lower pressure, its capacity was
increased three or four times.</p>

<p>The air was compressed to 100 lb. per sq. in. in the power-house,
and was delivered at about 80 lb. per sq. in. at the drills. A 3-in. air
line was used. The drill steel was 1&#8539;-to 1&#8540;-in. octagonal. The holes
were about 3&frac14; in. in diameter at starting and 2&#8541; in. at the full depth
of 10 ft. The powder used on the New York side was 40% Forcite,
the near presence of heavy buildings and lack of much rock cover
necessitating light charges and many holes spaced close together.</p>

<p>To compensate the contractor for the inevitable excavation done
outside the neat lines of the masonry lining, the excavation was paid
for to the "Standard Section Line" which was 12 in. outside the
neat lines on top and sides and 6 in. outside at the bottom of the
cross-section. The actual amount of excavation done was about 11%
greater than that paid for. The distance excavated beyond the neat
line, because of the very heavy timbering necessary, was about 2.1 ft.
instead of the 1 ft. allowed, and at the bottom about 0.85 ft. instead
of the 0.50 ft. paid for.</p>

<p>For a period of 5 months detailed records were kept of the drilling
and blasting. About 12,900 cu. yd. of excavation are included. A

used, is given in <a href="#Fig_5">Fig. 5</a>. From this and similar figures the information

     This gives the actual amount of drilling done and powder used
     per cubic yard for the whole period of 5 months of observation,
     but as this length included 280 ft. of heading and only 220 ft.
     of bench, the average figures (for powder especially) are too low.
  </p>
</div>

<p><a href="#TABLE_6">Table 6</a> gives the rate and cost of drilling, and the cost of powder.
It will be seen that the average rate of drilling was 2.71 ft. per hour
per drill or 27.1 ft. per drill per shift.</p>

<p><a href="#TABLE_7">Table 7</a> shows the result of observation as to the time taken in
various subdivisions of the drilling operations. These observations
were not carried on for a long enough period to give correct results,
but the percentages of time spent on each division of the operation are
believed to be about right. The headings of this table are self-explanatory.
The necessary delays include all time spent in changing
bits, making air-line connections, etc. The unnecessary delays are
stoppages caused by lack of supplies or insufficient air pressure.</p>

<p>By <a href="#TABLE_6">Table 6</a> it will be noticed that the cost of labor for drilling
and sharpening steels was about $0.29 per lin. ft. of hole drilled. The
total cost, including repairs, supply of air, etc., came to about $0.38,
as will be seen from <a href="#TABLE_8">Table 8</a>.</p>

<p><i>Timbering.</i>&mdash;On the New York side nearly the whole length of the
excavation needed timbering, to a greater or less extent, and for the
most part required timbering of quite a heavy type.

<p><i>General Methods.</i>&mdash;Whenever any considerable support was needed
for the ground, segmental timbering was used. In most cases, this was
supported by wall-plates at the springing line, and was set with an
allowance for settlement, so that it would be clear of the work when
the masonry lining was put in. As the twin-tunnel section involved
the excavation of the North and South Tunnels at the same time, the
cross-section of the upper part of the excavation consisted of two
quadrants rising from the springing line and connected at the top
by a horizontal piece from 19 to 28 ft. in length. This made a rather
flat arch to support by timbering.</p>

<p>The timber for the segmental work was 12 by 12-in. yellow pine.
In light ground the bents were spaced at 5-ft. centers, in heavy ground
2-ft. 6-in. centers.</p>

<p>When the soft ground in the roof was struck, posts had to be used
in the heading to support the caps. When the bench was removed, the
posts were replaced by others down to the bottom of the excavation.
These long posts were a great hindrance to all the work, and each
replacement of short posts by long ones meant a settlement of the
caps; consequently, it was decided to use in the section east of the
cut-and-cover, where all the ground was heavy, a temporary inner
bent of segmental timber, within and reinforcing the permanent bent,
and resting on separate wall-plates. This is shown by <a href="#Fig_6">Fig. 6</a>.
These temporary bents were inside the work, and were removed as the arch
was built. However, the caps settled considerably in some cases, so
that it was not possible to do away with posting entirely.

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span></p>

<p>In heavy ground the caps were set about 1 ft. above the neat line
of the crown of the brick arch, in some cases they were set only 6 in.
above, but the settlement was often more than this, causing great
trouble in cutting out the encroaching timber when the arch had to be
built.</p>

<p>In the tunnels east of the cut-and-cover portion, wall-plate headings
were driven (shown by areas marked <i>A</i>on <a href="#Fig_5">Fig. 5</a>),
and, when a length of wall-plate had been set, the full-width heading was advanced a foot
or two at a time, the timber segmental bents being set up as soon as
possible; lagging was then driven over the cap into the soft ground.
<a href="#Fig_6">Fig. 6</a> shows the double set of segmental bents adopted in the 15-ft.
4-in. twin tunnels east of the cut-and-cover section.</p>

<p>When the soft ground came down so low as to interfere with the
excavation of the wall-plate headings, a small heading was driven into
the soft ground on the line of the ends of the caps, and lagging was
driven down from this to the wall-plate heading, as illustrated in <a href="#Fig_4">Fig. 4</a>.

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span></p>

<p>In the 19-ft. 6-in. tunnels the wall-plate for the inner bent was
supported by a side-bench, termed the "Raker" bench. This was left
in position until the rest of the bench and the middle subgrade conduit
trench had been excavated; it was then possible to support the
caps by two rows of posts from subgrade level, take out the inner
bents, and excavate the raker bench.</p>

<p>The 24-ft. 6-in. twin tunnels, which are at the extreme eastern end
of this section, adjoining the open-cut work of the Terminal Station,
and under Tenth Avenue, were driven from the Terminal Station-West,
and the timbering had to be made very secure on account of the
pipes and sewers in the street above. Detailed records were kept of
the amount of timber used and the cost of labor and material expended
in timbering. These records cover the same portion of tunnel
as that for which the detailed records of drilling costs, previously
referred to, were kept. These records are shown in <a href="#TABLE_9">Tables 9</a>
and <a href="#TABLE_10">10</a>. It will be noted that the timber used in blocking,
that is, filling up voids outside the main timbering, amounted to more than two-thirds
of the total timber, and that the cost of labor in erecting the timbering
exceeds the prime cost of the timber by about one-third. The following
distinction is made between permanent and temporary timbering:
The permanent timbering is that which is concreted in when the
masonry is built; the temporary consists of the lower bents and posts,
which have to be removed when the masonry is built.</p>

<p><i>Force Employed in Excavation.</i>&mdash;A typical day's working force for
drilling, blasting, mucking, and timbering is shown in <a href="#TABLE_11">Table 11</a>.</p>

<p>Where there was any large quantity of soft ground in the roof, the
timber gang was much larger than shown in <a href="#TABLE_11">Table 11</a>, and was helped
by the mucking gang. The drillers did most of the mucking out of
the heading before setting up the drills.</p>

<p><i>Excavation of Weehawken Rock Tunnels.</i>&mdash;This subject may be dismissed
in a few words, as very few features of interest were called
into play. The rock was of good quality, being the sandstone typical
of this part of the country. Little or no timbering was needed, there
were no buildings above the tunnel to be taken care of, and large
charges of powder could be used.

<p>Work was begun on September 1st, 1904, immediately on the completion
of the work on the shaft. The North and South Tunnels in
this case are completely independent, as will be seen from
<a href="#PLATE_XXXIV">Plate
XXXIV</a>. The procedure adopted was to drive a top heading on
the center line of each tunnel and to break down the bench from
this. The drilling was at first supplied with steam power from a
temporary plant, as the contractor was at that time installing his
permanent plant, which was finished at the end of November, 1904.
At this time the rate of advance averaged 3&frac12; lin. ft. of full section
per day of 24 hours. By the end of January the Weehawken rock
tunnels were completely excavated, and by the middle of April, 1905,
the excavation for the shield chambers was finished; the erection of
the shields was started at the end of that month.</p>

<p>The general scheme of excavation is shown by Plate <a href="#PLATE_XXXIII">XXXIII</a>.
The bench was kept 50 or 60 ft. behind the face of the heading. The
powder used was 60% Forcite. The general system of drilling was as
shown in <a href="#Fig_7">Fig. 7</a>. The average length of hole drilled per cubic yard
of excavation was 2.9 ft., as against 7.70 ft. at Manhattan; and the
amount of powder used was 1.96 lb. per cu. yd., as against 1.24 lb. at
Manhattan. There was little timbering. A length of about 30 or
40 ft. adjoining the Weehawken shaft was timbered, and also a shattered
seam of about 17 ft. in width between Stations 262&nbsp;+&nbsp;10 and
262&nbsp;+&nbsp;27.</p>

<p>The two entirely separate tunnels gave a cross-section which was
much more easily timbered than the wide flat span at Manhattan, and
the segmental timbering was amply strong without posts or other
reinforcement.</p>

<h3>Masonry Lining of Land Tunnels.</h3>

<p><a href="#PLATE_XXXII">Plates XXXII</a> and <a href="#PLATE_XXXIV">XXXIV</a>
 show in detail the tunnels as they were
actually built. It will be seen that in all work, except in the Gy-East
contract, there was a bench at each side of each tunnel in which the
cable conduits were embedded. In Gy-East the bank of ducts which
came next to the middle wall was carried below subgrade, and the inner
benches were omitted.</p>

<p>The side-walls and subgrade electric conduits were water-proofed
with felt and pitch. The water-proofing was placed on the outside
of the side-walls (that is, on the neat line), and the space between
the rock and the water-proofing was filled with concrete.  This
concrete was called the "Sand-Wall."

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span></p>

<p>The general sequence of building the masonry lining is shown
in <a href="#Fig_8">Fig. 8</a>. The operations were as follows:</p>

<blockquote><p>1.&mdash;Laying concrete for the whole height of the sand-walls, and
for the floor and foundations for walls and benches up to
the level of the base of the conduits;</p>

<p>2.&mdash;Water-proofing the side-walls, and, where there was a middle
trench containing subgrade conduits, laying and water-proofing
these conduits;</p>

<p>3.&mdash;Building concrete wall for conduits to be laid against, and,
where there was a middle trench, filling up with concrete
between the conduits;</p>

<p>4.&mdash;Laying conduits;</p>

<p>5.&mdash;Laying concrete for benches and middle-wall;</p>

<p>6.&mdash;Building haunches from top of bench to springing of brick
arch;</p>

<p>7.&mdash;Building brick arch and part of concrete back-filling;</p>

<p>8.&mdash;Finishing back-filling.</p></blockquote>

<p>The whole work will be generally described under the headings
of Concrete, Brickwork, Water-proofing, and Electric Conduits.</p>

<p><i>Concrete.</i>&mdash;The number of types and the obstructions caused by
the heavy posting of the timbering made it inadvisable to use built-up
traveling forms at the Manhattan side, though they were used
in the Weehawken Rock Tunnels.</p>

<p>The specifications required a facing mixture of mortar to be deposited
against the forms simultaneously with the placing of the
concrete. This facing mixture was dry, about 2 in. thick, and was
kept separate from the concrete during the placing by a steel diaphragm.
The diaphragm was removed when the concrete reached
the top of each successive layer, and the facing mixture and concrete
were then tamped down together. This method was at first followed
and gave good results, which was indeed a foregone conclusion, as the
Weehawken shaft had been built in this way. However, it was found
that as good results, in the way of smooth finish, were to be obtained
without the facing mixture by spading the concrete back from the
forms, so that the stone was forced back and the finer portion of the
mixture came against the forms; this method was followed for
the rest of the work. All corners were rounded off on a 1-in. radius
by mouldings tacked to the forms. The side-bench forms were
used about four times, and were carefully scraped, planed, filled
at open joints, and oiled with soap grease each time they were set up.
When too rough for face work they were used for sand-wall and
other rough work.</p>

<p>The mixing was done by a No. 4 Ransome mixer, driven by 30-h.p. electric
motors. The mixer at Manhattan was set on an elevated platform at the
north end of the intercepting arch; that at Weehawken was placed at the
entrance to the tunnels. The sand and stone were stored in bins above
the mixers, and were led to the hoppers of the mixers through chutes.
The hoppers were divided into two sections, which gave the correct
quantities of sand and stone, respectively, for one batch. The water was
measured in a small tank alongside. A "four-bag" batch was the amount
mixed at one time, that is, it consisted of 4 bags of cement, 8&frac34; cu.
ft. of sand, and 17&frac12; cu. ft. of broken stone, and was called a 1 :
2&frac12; : 5 mixture. It measured when mixed about &frac34; cu. yd.</p>

<p>The cement was furnished to the contractor by the Railroad
Company, which undertook all the purchasing from the manufacturer,
as well as the sampling, testing, and storing until the contractor
needed it. The Railroad Company charged the contractor $2 a barrel
for this material.</p>

<p>The sand was required by the specifications to be coarse, sharp,
and silicious, and to contain not more than 0.5% of mica, loam,
dirt, or clay. All sand was carefully tested before being used. The
stone was to be a sound trap or limestone, passing a 1&frac12;-in. mesh
and being retained on &#8540;-in. mesh. The contractor was allowed to
use a coarser stone than this, namely, one that had passed a 2-in.
and was retained on a 1&frac12;-in. mesh.</p>

<p>The concrete was to be machine-mixed, except in cases of local
necessity. The quantity of water used in the mixture was to be such
that the concrete would quake on being deposited, but the engineer
was to use his discretion on this point. Concrete was to be deposited
in such a manner that the aggregates would not separate. It was
to be laid in layers, not exceeding 9 in. in thickness, and thoroughly
rammed. When placing was suspended, a joint was to be formed in
a manner satisfactory to the engineer. Before depositing fresh concrete,
the entire surface on which it was to be laid was to be cleaned,
washed and brushed, and slushed over with neat cement grout. Concrete
which had begun to set was not to be used, and retempering
was not to be allowed.</p>

<p>The forms were to be substantial and hold their shape until the
concrete had set. The face forms were to be of matched and dressed
planking, finished to true lines and surfaces; adequate measures
were to be taken to prevent concrete from adhering to the forms.
Warped or distorted forms were to be replaced. Plastering the face
was not allowed. Rock surfaces were to be thoroughly washed and
cleaned before the concrete was deposited.</p>

<p>These specifications were followed quite closely.</p>

<p>The superintendent and assistant engineer looked after the brickwork
and other work as well as the concrete. The surface transport
gang handled all the materials on the surface, including the fetching
of the cement from the cement warehouses.</p>

<p>The tunnel transport gang handled all materials in the tunnel,
but, when the haul became too long, the gang was reinforced with
laborers from the laying gang. Of the laying gang, two generally
did the spading, two the spreading and tamping, and the remaining
force dumped the concrete. The general cost of this part of the
work is shown in <a href="#TABLE_13">Table 13</a>.</p>

<p>The figures in <a href="#TABLE_13">Table 13</a> include the various items built into the
concrete and some that are certificate extras in connection with the
concrete, such as drains, ironwork and iron materials, rods and bars,
expanded metal, doors, frames and fittings, etc.</p>

<p><i>Water-proofing.</i>&mdash;According to the specifications, the water-proofing
was to consist of seven layers of pitch and six layers of felt on
the side-walls and a &frac12;-in. layer of mastic, composed of coal-tar and
Portland cement, to be plastered over the outside of the arches.</p>

<p>By the time the work was in hand, some distrust had arisen as
to the efficiency of this mastic coating, and a great deal of study
was devoted to the problem of how to apply a felt and pitch water-proofing
to the arches. The difficulty was that there was no room between
the rock and the arch or between the timber and the arch
(as the case might be) in which to work. Several ingenious schemes
of putting the felt on in layers, or in small pieces like shingles, were
proposed and discussed, and a full-sized model of the tunnel arch
was even built on which to try experiments, but it was finally
decided to overcome the difficulty by leaving out the arch water-proofing
altogether, and simply building in pipes for grouting through
under pressure, in case it was found that the arch was wet.</p>

<p>As to the arch built through the length excavated by cut-and-cover
on the New York side, it was resolved to water-proof that with
felt and pitch exactly as the side-walls were done, the spandrel
filling between the arches being raised in a slight ridge along the
concrete line between tunnels in order to throw the water over to

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>

the sides. The portions of arch not water-proofed were rather wet,
and grouting with a 1:1 mixture was done, but only with the effect
of stopping large local leaks and distributing a general dampness
over the whole surface of the arch.</p>

<p>The 24-ft. 6-in. tunnel adjoining the Terminal Station-West was
water-proofed by a surface-rendering method which, up to the present
time, has been satisfactory. Generally speaking, the arches of the
Land Tunnels, though not dripping with water, are the dampest parts
of the whole structure from Tenth Avenue to Weehawken, and it
would seem as if some form of water-proofing over these arches would
have been a distinct advantage.</p>

<p>There was no difficulty in applying the water-proofing on the side-walls,
after a little experience had been gained as to the best methods.
The specifications required the sand-wall to be covered with alternate
layers of coal-tar pitch and felt, seven layers of the former and six
layers of the latter, the felt to be of Hydrex brand or other equally
satisfactory to the engineer. The pitch was to be straight-run, coal-tar
pitch which would soften at 60&deg; Fahr., and melt at 100&deg; Fahr.,
being a grade in which distillate oils, distilled from it, should have
a specified gravity of 1.105. The pitch was to be mopped on the
surface to a uniform thickness of 1/16 in., and a covering of felt, previously
mopped with pitch, was to be applied immediately. The sheets
were to lap not less than 4 in. on cross-joints and 12 in. on longitudinal
joints, and had to adhere firmly to the pitch-covered surface.
This layer was then to be mopped, and another layer placed, and so
on until all the layers were in place. This water-proofing was to
extend from the bottom of the cable conduits to the springing of
the brick arch. Where sub-track conduits were used, these were to be
surrounded with their own water-proofing. The work was carried out
as specified; the sand-walls were not rendered, but were built smooth
enough to apply the water-proofing directly to them. They were dried
with gasoline torches before the application of the pitch, and in very
wet sections grooves were cut to lead the water away.</p>

<p>The first attempts were with the felt laid in horizontal strips.
This ended very disastrously, as the pitch could not sustain the
weight of the felt, and the whole arrangement slipped down the wall.
The felt was then laid vertically, being tacked to a piece of horizontal
scantling at the top of the sand-wall and also held by a row of planks

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>

braced against it at about half its height. A layer of porous brick
was laid as a drain along the base of the water-proofing, covered by a
single layer of felt to prevent it from becoming choked with concrete.</p>

<p>The water-proofing of the sub-track conduits was troublesome,
as the numerous layers and the necessity for preserving the proper
laps in both directions between adjacent layers made the whole thing
a kind of Chinese puzzle. Various modifications, to suit local conditions,
were made from time to time. Conduits outside the general
outline of the tunnel are difficult to excavate, to lay, and to water-proof,
and should be avoided wherever possible.</p>

<p>The usual force in water-proofing consisted of a foreman, at $3.50
per day, and nine laborers at $1.75 per day. These men not only
laid the water-proofing, but transported the materials, heated the pitch,
and cut up the rolls of felt. In general, two men transported material,
one tended the heater, and the other six worked in pairs, two
preparing the surface of the concrete sand-wall, two laying pitch,
and two laying felt.</p>

<p>The cost of the water-proofing operation was about as shown in
<a href="#TABLE_14">Table 14</a>.</p>

<p><i>Brickwork in Arches.</i>&mdash;Owing to the heavy timbering, the brickwork
at Manhattan was interfered with to a considerable extent, and
the gang was always kept at work at two or more places. The work
was carried up to a point where it was necessary to back-fill, or prop
or cut away encroaching timbers, and then the men were moved to
another place while this was being done.</p>

<p>The centers were set up in sets of seven, spaced 4 ft. apart. Two

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>

14-ft. lengths of 3 by 4-in. yellow pine lagging were used with each
set of ribs, with 24 by 8-in. block lagging in the crown.</p>

<p>All centers were set &frac14; in. high, to allow for settlement, except
in the 24-ft. 6-in. span, in which they were set &frac12; in. high. This proved
ample, the average settlement of the ribs being 0.01 ft. and of the
masonry, 0.003 ft. In the 24-ft. 6-in. span the ribs were strengthened
with 6 by 6-in. blocking and 12 by 12-in. posts to subgrade. Great
trouble was here encountered with encroaching timbering, due to the
settlement of the wide flat span. Grout pipes were built in, as previously
mentioned.</p>

<p>Each mason laid an average of 0.535 cu. yd. of brickwork per hour,
or 4.28 cu. yd. per day. The number of bricks laid per mason per
hour was 218, or 1,744 per day.</p>

<p>The bricks were of the best quality of vitrified paving brick, and
were obtained from the Jamestown Brick Company, of Jamestown,
N. Y. The average size was 8&frac34; by 3-15/16 by 2-7/16 in.; the average number
per cubic yard of masonry was 408, the arches being from 19 ft.
to 24 ft. 6 in. in span and from 22 to 27 in. thick. The joints were
3/16 in. at the face and averaged 9/16 in. through the arch.</p>

<p>The proportions for mortar were 1 of cement and 2&frac12; of sand.
One cubic yard of masonry was composed of 73.5% brick and 26.5%
mortar. The volume of the ingredients in a four-bag batch was 12.12
cu. ft., and the resulting mixture was 9.54 cu. ft. The number of
barrels of cement was 0.915 per cu. yd. of masonry, and about 17.7%
of the mortar made was wasted. The average force employed was:</p>

<p><i>Vitrified  Earthenware Conduits for Electric Cables.</i>&mdash;The general
drawings will show how the ducts were arranged, and that manholes were
provided at intervals. They were water-proofed, in the case of those
embedded in the bench, by the general water-proofing of the tunnels,
which was carried down to the level of the bottom of the banks of
ducts; and in the case of those below subgrade, by a special water-proofing
of felt and pitch wrapped around the ducts themselves.</p>

<p>The portion of wall in front of the ducts was bonded to that behind
by bonds, mostly of expanded metal, passing between the ducts.
Examples of the bonding will be seen in the drawings.</p>

<p>The joints between successive lengths of 4-way and 2-way ducts
were wrapped with two thicknesses of cotton duck, 6 in. wide, those
of single-way ducts were not wrapped, but plastered with cement mortar.
The ducts were laid on beds of mortar, and were made to break
joints at top and bottom and side to side with the adjacent ducts.
They were laid with a wooden mandrel; a square leather washer at
the near end acted as a cleanser when the mandrel was pulled
through.</p>

<p>The specifications required the ducts to be laid at the same time
as the concrete and be carried up with it, but this was found to be
a very awkward operation, as the tamping of the concrete and the

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>

walking of men disturbed the ducts, especially as the bonds lay across
them. It was resolved, therefore, to build the portion of the wall
behind the ducts first, with the bonds embedded in it at the proper
heights and projecting from it, then to lay up the banks of ducts
against this wall, bending the bonds down as they were reached,
and finally, after all the ducts were in, to lay the concrete in front
of and over the top of the ducts. Several detailed modifications of
this general scheme were followed at one time or another when necessary
or advisable.</p>

<p>The laying of ducts below subgrade was not complicated by the
presence of bonds, the water-proofing caused the trouble here, as before
described.</p>

<p>The specifications called for a final rodding after completion. A
group of the apparatus used in this process is shown in <a href="#PLATE_XXXV_Fig_1">
Fig. 1, Plate XXXV</a>; the various parts are identified by the following key:</p>

three or four men being used on the rods. All the ducts in a bank
were thus rodded from manhole to manhole. When a duct was rodded
it was plugged at each end with a wooden plug. A solid wooden
paraffined plug was used at first, but afterward an expansion plug
was used.</p>

<p>Very little trouble was met in rodding the power conduits, except
for a few misplaced ducts, or a small mound of mortar or a laying
mandrel left in. At such points a cut was made in the concrete
and the duct replaced.</p>

<p>In the subgrade telephone and telegraph ducts east of the Manhattan
Shaft, much trouble was caused by grout in the ducts. The
mandrel and cutters were deflected and broke through the web of the
ducts rather than remove this hard grout. Trenches had to be cut
from the floor to the top of the water-proofing, the latter was then
cut and folded back, and the ducts replaced. To do this, a number
of ducts had to be taken out to replace the broken ones and get the
proper laps. The water-proofing was then patched and the concrete
replaced. This grout had not penetrated the water-proofing, but had
got in through the ends of the ducts where they had not been properly
plugged and protected. The duct gang, both for laying and rodding,
generally consisted of</p>

<p class="center">
1 Foreman, at $3.50 per day,<br />
and 9 laborers, at $1.75 per day.<br />
</p>

<p>When laying: 4 men were laying, 2 men mixing and carrying
mortar, and 3 were transporting material. When rodding: 4 men
were rodding, 2 men at adjacent manholes were connecting and disconnecting
cutters and mandrels, 1 was joining up rods, and 2 men
assisting generally.</p>

<p>The cost of this work is shown in <a href="#TABLE_17">Table 17</a>.</p>

<h3>Transportation and Disposal.</h3>

<p>The track on the surface and in the tunnels was of 20-lb. rails
on a 2-ft. gauge.</p>

<p>The excavation was handled in scale-boxes carried on flat cars,
and the concrete in 1&frac14;-cu. yd. mining cars dumping either at the side
or end.</p>

<p>When the haulage was up grade, 6 by 6-in. Lidgerwood hoisting
engines, with 10-in. single friction drums, and driven by compressed
air from the high-pressure lines, were used. Down grade, cars were
moved and controlled by hand.</p>

<p>The muck which came through the shaft at Manhattan was dumped
into hopper bins on the surface and thence loaded into trucks at convenience.
At the open cut, the muck was dumped into trucks direct.
The trucking was sublet by the contractor to a sub-contractor, who
provided trucks, teams, and trimmers at the pier. At Weehawken,
arrangements were made with the Erie Railroad which undertook to
take muck which was needed as fill. The tunnel cars, therefore,
were dumped directly on flat cars which were brought up to a roughly
made platform near the shaft.</p>

<p>The hoisting at Manhattan was by derrick at Tenth Avenue and
the open cut, and by the elevator at the Manhattan Shaft. At Weehawken,
all hoisting was done by the elevator in the shaft.</p>

<p>The sand and stone were received at the wharves by scows. At
Manhattan, these materials were unloaded on trucks by an overhead
traveler, and teamed to the shaft, where they were unloaded by derricks
into the bins. At Weehawken, they were unloaded by an orange-peel
grab bucket, loaded into cars on the overhead trestle, transported
in these to the top of the shaft, and discharged into the bins.</p>

<p>The cement at Manhattan was trucked from the Company's warehouse,
at Eleventh Avenue and 38th Street, to the shaft, where it was

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>

put into a supplementary storage shed at the top of the shaft, whence
it was removed to the mixer by the elevator when needed. At Weehawken,
it was taken on flat cars directly from the warehouse to the
mixer.</p>

<h3>Lighting.</h3>

<p>Temporarily and for a short time at the start, kerosene flares
were used for light until replaced by electric lights, the current for
which was furnished by the contractor's generators, which have been
described under the head of "Power Plant."</p>

<p>The lamps used along the track were of 16 c.p., and were protected
by wire screens; these were single, but, wherever work was
going on, groups of four or five, provided with reflectors, were used.</p>

<h3>Pumping.</h3>

<p>Two pumps were installed at the Manhattan Shaft. They had to
handle the water, not only from the rock tunnels, but also from
those under the river. One was a Deane compound duplex pump,
having a capacity of 500 gal. per min., the other, a Blake pump, of 150
gal. per min. They were first driven by steam direct from the power-house,
but compressed air was used later. When the power-house was
shut down, an electrically-driven centrifugal pump was used. This
was driven by a General Electric shunt-wound motor, Type C-07&frac12;,
with a speed of 1,250 rev. per min. at 250 volts and 37.5 amperes
(10 h.p.) when open, and 22.9 amperes (6 h.p.) when closed, and
had a capacity of 450 gal. per min. To send the water to the shaft
sump during the construction, small compressed-air Cameron pumps,
of about 140 gal. per min., were used.</p>

<p>At the Weehawken shaft two pumps were used; these dealt with
the water from the Bergen Hill Tunnels as well as that from the
Weehawken Tunnels. At first a Worthington duplex pump having a
capacity of about 500 gal. per min. was used. Later, this was replaced
by a General Electric shunt-wound motor, Type O-15, with a
speed of 925 rev. per min. at 230 volts and 74 amperes (20 h.p.) when
open, and 38.5 amperes (10 h.p.) when closed. Its capacity was 240
gal. per min. During the progress of the construction, the water was
pumped from the working face to the shaft by small Cameron pumps
similar to those used at Manhattan. When the work was finished,

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>

a subgrade reversed-grade drain carried the water to the shaft sump
by gravity.</p>

<p>The work in the Manhattan Land Tunnels was practically finished
by May 1st, 1908, though the ventilating arrangements and overhead
platform in the intercepting arch were not put in until after the
River Tunnel concrete was completed, so that the work was not
finished until September, 1909.</p>

<p>The Weehawken Land Tunnels work was finished in July, 1907,
but the benches and ventilating arrangements in the Weehawken
Shaft were not put in until after the completion of the Bergen Hill
Tunnels, and so were not finished until August, 1909.</p>

<p>The reinforced concrete wall around the Weehawken Shaft, together
with the stairs from the bench level of the shaft to the surface,
was let as a separate contract; the work was started on September
15th, 1909, and finished by the end of December, 1909.</p>

<h2>River Tunnels.</h2>

<p>The River Tunnel work, from some points of view, has the most
interest. It is interesting because it is the first main line crossing of
the formidable obstacle of the Hudson River, and also by reason of
the long and anxiously discussed point as to whether, in view of the
preceding experiences and failures to construct tunnels under that
river, foundations were needed under these tunnels to keep them from
changing in elevation under the action of heavy traffic.</p>

<p>The River Tunnels here described start on the east side of the
shield chambers on the New York side and end at the east side of the
shield chambers on the New Jersey side. They thus include the New
York and exclude the New Jersey shield chambers, the reason for such
discrimination being that the New York shield chambers are lined
with cast iron while those on the New Jersey side are of the typical
rock section type, as already described. The design of the tunnels and
their accessories will be first described, then will come the construction
of the tunnels as far as the completion of the metal lining, followed
by a description of the concrete lining and completion of the work.</p>

<h3>Design of Metal Lining.</h3>

<p><i>New York Shield Chambers.</i>&mdash;The shield chambers may be seen on
<a href="#PLATE_XXXII">Plate XXXII</a>, previously referred to, which shows the junction of
the iron-lined tunnels and the shield chambers. They consist of two

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>

iron-lined pieces of tunnel placed side by side, with semi-circular
arches and straight side-walls. The segments of the arch are made to
break joint with one another by making the side-wall or column castings
of two different heights, as shown in <a href="#Fig_9">Fig. 9</a>. The length of each
ring is 18 in.</p>

<p>The reason for the adoption of this type of construction was the
necessity for keeping the width of the permanent structure within the
60-ft. width of the street. The length of this twin structure is
28.5 ft., and the weight of the metal in it is as follows:</p>

<p><i>General Type of River Tunnel Lining.</i>&mdash;The main ruling type
adopted for the tunnels under the Hudson River, and in the soft water-bearing
ground for some distance on the shoreward side of the river
lines, consists of two parallel metal-lined tunnels, circular in cross-section,
each tunnel being 23 ft. outside diameter, and the two tunnels
37 ft. apart from center to center, as shown on <a href="#Fig_10">Fig. 10</a>. The metal
lining is of cast iron (except for a few short lengths of cast steel) and
of the usual segmental type, consisting of "Rings" of iron, each ring
being 2 ft. 6 in. in length, and divided by radial joints into eleven
segments, or "Plates," with one "Key," or closing segment, having
joints not radial but narrower at the outside circumference of the
metal lining than at the inside. The whole structure is joined, segment
to segment, and ring to ring, by mild-steel bolts passing through
bolt holes in flanges of all four faces of each segment. The joints
between the segments are made water-tight by a caulking of sal-ammoniac
and iron borings driven into grooves formed for the purpose
on the inner edges of the flanges. The clearances between the bolts
and the bolt holes are also made water-tight by using grummets or
rings of yarn smeared with red lead, having a snug fit over the shank
of the bolt and placed below the washer on either end of each bolt.
When passing through ground more or less self-sustaining, the space
outside the iron lining (formed by the excavation being necessarily
rather larger than the external diameter of the lining itself) was
filled with grout of 1:1 Portland cement and sand forced by air
pressure through grout holes in each segment.  These holes were
tapped, and were closed with a screw plug before and after grouting.

ruling type will be given.</p>

<p>The two main divisions of the iron lining are the "ordinary" or
lighter type and the heavy type. The details of the ordinary iron
are shown in <a href="#Fig_11">Fig. 11</a>, which shows all types of lining. It was on this
design that the contract was let, and it was originally intended that
this should be the only type of iron used. The dimensions of the iron
are clearly shown on the drawing, and it will be seen that the external
diameter is 23 ft., the interior diameter, 21 ft. 2 in., the length of each
ring, 2 ft. 6 in., and the thickness of the iron skin or web, 1&frac12; in. The
bolt holes in the circumferential flanges are evenly spaced through the

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>

circle, so that adjacent rings may be bolted together in any relative
position as regards the radial joints, and, as a matter of fact, in the
erection of the tunnel lining, all the rings "break joint," with the
exception of those at the bore segments, as will be described later.
This type of iron, when the original type was modified, came to be
known as the ordinary pocketless iron; that is, the weight is of the
ordinary or lighter type, in contradistinction to the heavier one, which
later supplanted it, and the caulking groove runs along the edges of
the flanges and does not form pockets around the bolt holes, as did the
groove in a later type.</p>

<p>Each ring is made up of eleven segments and a key piece. Of
these, nine have radial joints at both ends, and are called "<i>A</i>" segments;
two, called "<i>B</i>" segments, have a radial joint at one end and a
non-radial joint at the other. The non-radial joint is placed next to
the key, which is 12.25 in. wide at the outside circumference of the
iron and 12.50 in. wide at the inside.</p>

<p>The web is not of uniform thickness. The middle part of each
<i>A</i> and <i>B</i> segment is 1&frac12; in. thick; at the distance of 6 in. from the root
of each flange, the thickness of web begins to increase, so that at the
root it is 2&#8540; in. thick. The web of the key plate is 1&frac34; in. thick.</p>

<p>The bolts are of mild steel, and are 1&frac12; in. in diameter; there are
67 in one circumferential joint and 5 in each radial joint. As there
are 12 such radial joints, there are altogether 60 bolts in the cross-joints,
making a total of 127 bolts per ring.</p>

<p>This original type of ordinary iron was modified for a special
purpose as follows: It was known that for some distance on either
side of the river, and especially at Weehawken, the tunnels would pass
through a gravel formation, rather open, and containing a heavy head
of water. It was thought that, by carrying the caulking groove
around the bolt holes, it would be possible to make them more water-proof
than by the simple use of the red-leaded grummets. Hence the
"Pocket Iron" was adopted for this situation, the name being derived
from the pocket-like recess which the caulking groove formed when
extended around the bolt hole. The details of this lining are shown
on <a href="#Fig_11">Fig. 11</a>, and the iron (except for the pockets) is exactly like the
pocketless type.

<p>On the New York side, in both North and South Tunnels, two
short lengths were built with cast-steel lining. This was done where
unusual stresses were expected to come on the lining, namely, at the
point where the invert passed from firm ground to soft, and also where
the tunnels passed under the heavy river bulkhead wall.</p>

<p>The design was precisely the same as for the ordinary pocketless
iron, and <a href="#Fig_11">Fig. 11</a> shows the details. After the tunnels had entered
into the actual under-river portion, several phenomena (which will be
described later) led to the fear that the tunnels, being lighter than the
semi-liquid mud they displaced, might be subject to a buoyant action,
and therefore a heavier type of lining was designed. The length of
ring, number of bolts, etc., were just the same as for the lighter iron,
but the thickness of the web was increased from 1&frac12; to 2 in., the thickness
of the flanges was proportionately increased, and the diameter of
the bolts was increased from 1&frac12; to 1&frac34; in. This iron was all of the
pocketless type, shown in <a href="#Fig_11">Fig. 11</a>. <a href="#TABLE_18">

<p>The weights in <a href="#TABLE_18">Table 18</a> are calculated by assuming cast iron to
weigh 450 lb. per cu. ft., and cast steel 490 lb. In actual practice the
"ordinary" iron was found to weigh a little more than the weights
given, and the "heavy" a little less.</p>

<p>The silt in the sub-river portion averaged about 100 lb. per cu. ft.,
so that the weight of the silt displaced by the tunnel was about
41,548 lb. per lin. ft.</p>

<p><i>Taper Rings.</i>&mdash;In order to pass around curves (whether horizontal
or vertical), or to correct deviation from line or grade, taper rings
were used; by this is meant rings which when in place in the tunnels
were wider than the standard rings, either at one side (horizontal
tapers or "Liners"), or at the top ("Depressors"), or at the bottom
("Elevators").</p>

<p>In the original design a &frac12;-in. taper was called for, that is, the wide
side of the ring was &frac12; in. wider than the narrow side, which was of the
standard width of 2 ft. 6 in. As a matter of fact, during construction,
not only &frac12;-in., but &frac34;-in. and 1-in. tapers were often used.</p>

<p>These taper rings necessitated each plate having its own unalterable
position in the ring, hence each plate of the taper ring was
numbered, so that no mistake could be made during erection.</p>

<p>The taper rings were made by casting a ring with one circumferential
flange much thicker than usual, and then machining off this
flange to the taper. This was not only much cheaper than making a
special pattern for each plate, but made it possible to see clearly where
and what tapers were used in the tunnel.</p>

<p>Taper rings were provided for all kinds of lining (except the cast
steel), and the lack of taper steel rings was felt when building the
steel-lined parts of the tunnel, as nothing could be done to remedy
deviations from line or grade until the steel section was over and cast
iron could again be used. <a href="#TABLE_19">Table 19</a> gives the weights
of the different kinds of tapers used.</p>

<p><i>Cast-Steel Bore Segments and Accessories.</i>&mdash;The following feature
of these tunnels is different from any hitherto built. It was the
original intention to carry the rolling load independent of the tunnel,
or to assist the support of the silt portion of the structure by a single
row of screw-piles, under each tunnel, and extending down to firmer
ground than that through which the tunnels were driven. Therefore,
provision had to be made whereby these piles could be put down
through the invert of the tunnel with no exposure of the ground.</p>

<p>This provision was afforded by the "Bore Segments," which are
shown in detail in <a href="#Fig_12">Fig. 12</a>. There are two segments, called No. 1
and No. 2, respectively. These two segments are bolted together in
the bottom of two adjacent rings, and thus form a "Pile Bore." As
the piles were to be kept at 15-ft. centers, and as the tunnel rings
were 2 ft. 6 in. in length, it will be seen that, between each pair of
bore-segment rings, there came four "Plain" rings. The plain rings
were built up so that the radial joints broke joint from ring to ring,
but with the bore-segment rings this could not be done, without unnecessarily
adding to the types of segments.

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span></p>

<p>The bore segments were made of cast steel, and were quite complicated
castings, the principle, however, was quite simple. The segments
provided an opening just a little larger than the shaft of the
pile, the orifice being 2 ft. 7 in. in diameter at the smallest (lowest)
point, while the shaft of the pile was to be 2 ft. 5&frac14; in. In order to
allow of the entry of the screw-blade or helix of the pile, a slot was
formed in the depth of Bore Segment No. 1, so that, when a pile
was put in position above the bore, the blade, when revolved, would
enter the slot and thus pass under the metal lining, although the
actual orifice was only slightly larger than the pile shaft.</p>

<p>The wall of the pile orifice in Segment No. 2 was made lower
than that in No. 1 so as to allow the blade to enter the slot in Segment
No. 1. When the pile is not actually in process of being sunk,
this lower height in No. 2 is made up with the removable "distance
piece." This had a tongue at one end which engaged in a recess cast
to take it in Segment No. 2 and was held in place by a key piece
at the other end of the distance piece. Details of the distance piece
and key are shown in <a href="#Fig_12">Fig. 12</a>.</p>

<p>The flanges around the pile bore were made flat and furnished
with twelve tapped holes, six in Segment No. 1 and six in Segment
No. 2, for the purpose of attaching the permanent arrangements in
conjunction with which the pile was to be attached to the track system,
independently of the tunnel shell, or directly to the tunnel. It
was never decided which of these alternatives would be used, for, before
this decision was reached, it was agreed that, at any rate for
the present, it was better not to put down piles at all.</p>

<p>To close the bore, the "Bore Plug" was used. This is shown on
<a href="#Fig_12">Fig. 12</a>. It was of cast steel, and was intended to act as a permanent
point of the screw-pile, that is, the blade section was to be attached
to the bore plug, the distance piece and key were to be removed, and
the pile was to be rotated until the blade had cleared the slot; the
distance piece and key were then to be replaced and sinking resumed.</p>

<p>The plug was held in place against the pressure of the silt by
the two "dogs," while the dogs themselves were attached to the tunnel,
as shown in <a href="#Fig_12">Fig. 12</a>. The ends of the dogs, which rested on the
flanges of the metal lining of the tunnel, were prevented from being
knocked off the flanges (and thus releasing the plug) by steel clips.</p>

<p>It was expected that it might be desirable to keep the lower end

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>

of the piles open during their sinking, so that the bore plugs were not
made permanently closed, but a seating was formed on the inner
circumference of the plug, and on the seating was placed the "Plug
Cover," made of cast iron, 18&frac34; in. in diameter and 3 in. thick, furnished
with a lug for lifting and a 3-in. tapped hole closed by a
screw-plug, through which any soundings or samples of ground
could be taken prior to sinking the piles. This plug cover was held
in place by a heavy steel "Yoke" under it, which engaged on the
under side of the flange, on top of which the cover was set. The
yoke was attached to the cover by a 1&frac34;-in. tap-bolt, screwed into the
yoke and passing through a 2-in. hole bored in the center of the
cover. This rather peculiar mode of attaching the cover was adopted
so that the cover could be removed by taking off the nut of the yoke,
in case it was desired to open the end of the pile during the process
of sinking.</p>

<p>The plug was a fairly close fit at the bottom of the orifice, that
is, at the outside circumference of the tunnel, where the bore was
2 ft. 7 in. in diameter and the plug 2 ft. 6&frac34; in., but at the top of the
bore-segment there was more clearance, as the plug was cylindrical
while the bore tapered outward. To fill this space, it was intended
that steel wedges should be used while the shield was being driven,
so that they would withstand the crushing action of the thrusting
shield, and, when the shield was far enough ahead, that they should
be removed and replaced by hardwood wedges. This method was
only used in the early weeks of the work; the modification of not
using the shield-jacks which thrust against the bore segments was
then introduced, and the wooden wedges were put in, when the bore
plugs were set in place, and driven down to the stage of splitting.</p>

<p>When it was resolved not to sink the screw-piles, the bores had
to be closed before putting in the concrete lining. This was done
by means of the covers shown in <a href="#Fig_13">Fig. 13</a>. The bore plug and all
its attachments were removed, and the flat steel cover, 2 in. thick
and with stiffening webs on the under side, was placed over the
circular flanges of the pile bore. The cover was attached to the bore
segments by twelve 1&frac12;-in. stud-bolts, 6 in. long, in the bolt holes
already mentioned as provided on these flanges.</p>

<p>When these were in place, with lead grummets under the heads
of the bolts, and the grooves caulked, the bore segments were water-tight

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>tight,

except in Bore Segment No. 2, at the joint of the distance
piece; and, to keep water from entering here, this segment was filled
to the level of the top of the flanges with 1:1 Portland cement mortar.</p>

<p><i>Sump Segments.</i>&mdash;In order to provide sumps to collect the drainage
and leakage water in the subaqueous tunnels, special "sump segments"
were installed in each tunnel at the lowest point&mdash;about Station
241&nbsp;+&nbsp;00. The details of the design are shown in <a href="#Fig_14">Fig. 14</a>. The
segment was built into the tunnel invert as though it were an
ordinary "<i>A</i>" segment. In building the sump, three lining castings
were bolted, one on top of the other, and attached to the flat
upper surface of the sump segment; meanwhile, the bolts attaching
the sump segment to the adjacent tunnel plates were taken out and
the plate and lining segments were forced through the soft mud by
hydraulic jacks, the three 6-in. holes in the bottom of the sump
segment being opened in order to minimize the resistance. The sump
when built appeared as shown in <a href="#Fig_14">Fig. 14</a>, the top connection being
made with a special casting, as shown.</p>

<p>The capacity of each sump is 500 gal., which is about the quantity
of water entering the whole length of each subaqueous tunnel
in 24 hours.</p>

<p><i>Cross-Passages.</i>&mdash;When the contract was let, provision was made
for cross-passages between the tubular tunnels, in the form of special
castings to be built into the tunnel lining at intervals. However, the
idea was given up, and these castings were not made. Later, however,
after tunnel building had started, the question was raised again,
and it was thought that such cross-connections would be very useful
to the maintenance forces, that it might be possible to build them
safely, and that their subsequent construction would be made much
easier if some provision were made for them while the shields were
being driven. It was therefore arranged to build, at intervals of
about 300 ft., two consecutive rings in each tunnel, at the same station
in each tunnel, with their longitudinal flanges together, instead
of breaking joint, as was usually done. The keys of these rings
were displaced twelve bolt holes from their normal positions toward
the other tunnel. This brought the keys about 6 ft. above the bench,
so that if they were removed, together with the <i>B</i> plates below them,
an opening of about 5 by 7 ft. would be left in a convenient position
with regard to the bench.

<p>Nothing more was done until after the tunnels were driven. It
was then decided to limit the cross-passages between the tubular tunnels
to the landward side of the bulkhead walls. They were arranged
as follows: three on the New York side, at Stations 203&nbsp;+&nbsp;22,
206&nbsp;+&nbsp;80, and 209&nbsp;+&nbsp;80, and two on the New Jersey side, at
Stations 255&nbsp;+&nbsp;46 and 260&nbsp;+&nbsp;14. The cross-passages are square in
cross-section.</p>

<p><i>Turnbuckle Reinforcement for Cast-Iron Segments.</i>&mdash;During
the period of construction, a certain number of cast-iron segments,
mostly in the roof, but in some cases at Manhattan in the invert,
behind the river lines, became cracked owing to uneven pressures
of the ground. Before the concrete lining was put in, considerable
discussion occurred as to the wisest course to pursue with regard to
these broken plates. It was finally thought best not to take the plates
out, as more harm than good might be done, but to reinforce them
with turnbuckles, as shown in <a href="#Fig_15">Fig. 15</a>. The number of broken segments
was distributed as follows:</p>

<p>
North Manhattan Tunnel   87, chiefly in silt (not under the river),<br />
South Manhattan Tunnel    7, chiefly in silt (not under the river),<br />
North Weehawken Tunnel   24, chiefly in sand (not under the river),<br />
South Weehawken Tunnel   48, chiefly in silt, under the Fowler Warehouse.<br />
</p>

<p>The chief features of the tunnel lining have now been described,
and, before giving any account of the methods of work, it will be
well to mention briefly the salient features of the concrete lining
which is placed within the actual lining.</p>

<p><i>The New York Shield Chambers.</i>&mdash;The cross-section of the concrete
lining of these chambers is shown by <a href="#PLATE_XXXII">Plate XXXII</a>, referred
to in the Land Tunnel Section. They are of the twin-tunnel double-bench
type. The deep space beneath the floor is used as a sump for
drainage, and manholes for access to the cable conduits are placed
in the benches.</p>

</div>

<p><i>Standard Cross-Section of Concrete Lining of Shield-Driven
Tunnels.</i>&mdash;The cross-section of the concrete lining of the tube tunnel
is shown in <a href="#Fig_16">Fig. 16</a>. There are two main types, one extending from
the shield chambers to the first bore segment, that is, to where the
tunnel leaves solid ground and passes into silt, and the other which
extends the rest of the way. The first type has a drain in the invert,
the second has not.</p>

<p>The height from the top of the rail to the soffit of the arch being
less than 16 ft. 11 in., overhead pockets for the suspension of electrical
conductors were set in the concrete arch on the vertical axis
line at 10-ft. centers. These pockets are shown in <a href="#Fig_16">Fig. 16</a>. The
benches are utilized for the cable conduits in the usual way. Ladders
are provided on one side at 25-ft. and on the other side at 50-ft.

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>

intervals, to give access from the track level to the top of the benches.
Refuge niches for trackmen are placed at 25-ft. intervals on the single-way
conduits side only, as there is not enough room in front of the 4-way
ducts. Manholes for giving access to the cable conduits, both
power, and telephone and telegraph, are at 400-ft. intervals.</p>

<p><i>Final Lines and Grades, and How Obtained.</i>&mdash;It may be well to
explain here how the final lines and grades for the track, and therefore
for the concrete lining, were obtained and determined. It is first to
be premised that the standard cross-section of the tunnel (that is,
of the concrete and iron lining combined) is not maintained throughout
the tunnel. In other words, the metal lining is of course uniform,
or practically so, throughout; the interior surface of the concrete
lining is also uniform from end to end, but the metal lining, owing
to the difficulty of keeping the shields, and hence the tunnels built
within them, exactly on the true line and grade, is not on such lines
and grades; the concrete lining is built exactly on the pre-arranged
lines and grades, consequently, the relative positions of the concrete
and metal linings vary continually along the length of the structure,
according to whether the metal lining is higher or lower than it
should be, further to the north or to the south, or any combination
of these.</p>

<p>As before stated, it was strongly desired to encroach as little as
possible on the standard 2-ft. concrete arch, and after some discussion
it was decided that a thickness of 1 ft. 6 in. was the thinnest it
was advisable to allow. This made it possible to permit the metal
lining of the tunnel to be 6 in. lower, in respect to the level of the
track at any point, than the standard section shows, and also allowed
the center line of the track to have an eccentricity of 6 in. either
north or south of the center line of the tunnel. This only left to
be settled the extent to which the metal lining might be higher in
respect to the track than that shown on the standard section.</p>

<p>This amount was governed by the desirability of keeping sufficient
clearance between the top of the rail and the iron lining in the invert
to admit of the attachment of pile foundations and all the accompanying
girder-track system which would necessarily be caused
by the use of piles, should it ever become apparent after operation was
begun, that, after all, it was essential to have the tunnels supported
in this way. Careful studies were made of the clearance necessary,

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>

and it was decided that 4 ft. 9 in. was the minimum allowable depth
from the top of the rail to the outside of the iron at the bottom.
This meant that the iron lining could be 3 in. higher, with respect
to the track level, than that shown on the standard section.</p>

<p>All the determining factors for fixing the best possible lines and
grades for the track within the completed metal lining were now at
hand. In March, 1908, careful surveys of plan and elevation were
made of the tunnels at intervals of 25 ft. throughout. The following
operations were then performed to fix on the best lines and grades:</p>

<p>First, for Line: It has been explained that the permissible deviation
of the center line of the track on either side of the center line
of the tunnel was 6 in. Had the metal lining been invariably of the
true diameter, it would have been necessary to survey only one side
of the tunnel; this would have given a line parallel to the center
line, and might have been plotted as such; then, by setting off 6 in.
on either side of this line, there would have been obtained a pair
of parallel lines within which the center line of the track must lie.
Owing to variations in the diameter of the tunnel, however, such a
method was not permissible, and therefore the following process was
used:</p>

<p>When running the survey lines through the tunnel (which were
the center lines used in driving the shields), offsets were taken to
the inner edges of the flanges of the metal lining, both on the north
and south sides, at axis level at each 25-ft. interval. On the plat
on which the survey lines were laid down, and at each point surveyed,
a distance was laid off to north and south equal to the following
distances:</p>

<p>Offset, as measured in the tunnel to north (or south), minus
10.08 ft.</p>

<p>This 10.08 ft. (or 10 ft, 1 in.) represents 10 ft. 7 in., the true
radius to inside of iron, minus 6 in., the permissible lateral deviation
of the track from the axis of the tunnel.</p>

<p>The result of this process was two lines, one on either side of the
survey lines, not parallel to it or to each other, but approaching each
other when the horizontal diameter was less than the true diameter,
receding from each other when the diameter was more, and exactly
12 in. apart when the diameter was correct. As long as the center
line of the track lay entirely within these two limiting lines, the condition

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>

that the concrete arch should not be 6 in. less in thickness
than the standard 2 ft. was satisfied, and in order to arrive at the
final line, the longest possible tangents that would be within these
limits were adopted as the final lines; and, as the survey lines were
those used in driving the tunnel shields (that is, the lines to which
it was intended that the track should be built), the amount by which
the new lines thus obtained deviated from the survey lines was a
measure of the deviation of the finally adopted track and concrete
line from the original contract lines.</p>

<p>Next, for Grades: The considerations for grade were very similar
to those for line. If the vertical diameter of the tunnel had been
true at each 25-ft. interval surveyed, it would have been correct
to plot the elevations of the crown (or invert) as a longitudinal section
of the tunnel, and to have set up over those points others 6 in.
above (as the metal lining could have been 6 in. lower than the
standard section, which is equivalent to the track being an equal
amount higher), and below these crown or invert elevations others
3 in. lower (as the metal lining could be 3 in. higher).</p>

<p>Then, by joining the points 6 in. above in one line and those
3 in. below in another, there would have been obtained lines of limitation
between which the track grades must lie. However, as the tunnel
diameter was not uniformly correct, a modification of this method
had to be made, as in the case of the line determination, the principle,
however, remaining the same.</p>

<p>The elevations were taken on the inner edges of the circumferential
flanges of the metal lining, not only in the bottom, but also in
the top, of the tunnel, at each 25-ft. interval; then, for the upper
limit of the track at each such interval the following was plotted:</p>

<p>Elevation of inner edge of flange at top, minus 16.58 ft.</p>

<p>This 16.58 ft. (or 16 ft. 7 in.) was obtained thus: The standard
height from the top of the rail to the inner edge of the iron flange
is 17 ft. 1 in., but, as the track may be 6 in. above the standard or
normal, the minimum height permissible is 16 ft. 7 in. For the
lower limit of track at each 25-ft. interval the following was plotted:</p>

<p>Elevation of inner edge of flange at bottom, plus 3.83 ft.</p>

<p>This 3.83 ft. (or 3 ft. 10 in.) was obtained thus: The standard
height from the top of the rail to the inner edge of the iron flange
is 4 ft. 1 in. (5 ft. to outside of iron, less 11 in. for depth of flange),

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>

but, as the track may be 3 in. below the standard, the minimum
height permissible is 4 ft, 1 in. less 3 in., or 3 ft. 10 in.</p>

<p>By plotting the elevations thus obtained, two lines were obtained
which were not parallel but were closer together or further apart
according as the actual vertical diameter was less or greater than the
standard, and the track grade had to lie within these two lines in
order to comply with the requirements indicated above. The
results of these operations for the North Tunnel are shown on
<a href="#PLATE_XXXVI">Plate XXXVI</a>.</p>

<p>The greatest deviations between the lines and grades in the
subaqueous tunnels as determined by these means and those as
originally laid out in the contract drawings are on the Weehawken
side, and were caused by the unexpected behavior of the tunnel when
the shields were driven "blind" into the silt, causing a rise which
could not be overcome, and the thrusting aside of one tunnel by
the passage of the neighboring one. Had this unfortunate incident
not occurred, it is clear that it would have been possible to adhere
very closely indeed to the contract lines and grades, although the
deviation is small, considering all things.</p>

<p>The internal outline of the concrete cross-section is uniform
throughout, and is built on the lines and grades thus described.</p>

<p><i>Steel Rod Reinforcement of Concrete.</i>&mdash;The original intention
had been to line the metal lining of the tube tunnels with plain
concrete, but, as the discussion on the foundation question continued,
it was felt advisable, while still it was intended to put in the foundations,
to guard against any stresses which were likely to come on
the structure, by using a system of steel rods embedded circumferentially
within the concrete. Designs were made on this basis, and
even the necessary material prepared, before the decision to omit the
piles altogether was reached. However, in order to provide a safeguard
for the structure where it is partly or wholly beyond the solid
rock, it was decided to use reinforcement, even with the piles omitted.</p>

<p>For this purpose the tunnel was considered as a girder, and
longitudinal reinforcement was provided at the top and bottom. The
top reinforcement extends from a point 25 ft. behind the point where
the crown of the tunnel passes out of rock on the New York side
to where the crown passes into rock on the New Jersey side. The
bottom reinforcement extends from where the invert of the tunnel
passes out of rock on the New York side to where it passes into
rock on the New Jersey side.

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span></p>

<p>The reinforcement both at top and bottom consists of twenty
1-in. square twisted rods, ten placed symmetrically on either side
of the vertical axis, 9 in. apart from center to center and set 4 in.
(to their centers) back from the face of the concrete.</p>

<p>As a further precaution, circumferentially-placed rods were used
on the landward side of the river lines, mainly to assist in preventing
the distortion of shape which might occur here, either under present
conditions, such as under the Fowler Warehouse at Weehawken, or
under any possible different future conditions, such as might be
brought about by building some new structure in the vicinity of
the tunnels.</p>

<p>For purposes of classification of the circumferential reinforcement,
the tunnel was divided into two types, "<i>B</i>" and "<i>C</i>"; (Type
"<i>A</i>" covering the portion which, being wholly in solid rock, was not
reinforced at all).</p>

<p>Type "<i>B</i>" covers the part of the tunnels on both sides of the river
lying between the point where the top of the tunnel passes out of
rock and the point where the invert passes out of rock on the Manhattan
side, or out of gravel on the Weehawken side. The reinforcement
consists of twenty 1-in. square longitudinal rods in the crown
of the tunnel, as described for the general longitudinal reinforcement,
together with 1-in. square circumferential rods at 10-in. centers,
and extending over the arch to 2 ft. 3 in. below the horizontal axis.</p>

<p>Type "<i>C</i>" extends from the latter limit of Type "<i>B</i>" to the
river line on each side, and consists of longitudinal reinforcement
in both top and bottom, as described before, together with circumferential
reinforcement entirely around the tunnel, and formed of
1-in. square twisted rods at 15-in. centers.</p>

<p>Type "<i>D</i>" consists of longitudinal reinforcement only, and extends
from river line to river line, thus occupying 72.5% of the length in
which concrete is used. The reinforcement consists of twenty 1-in.
twisted rods at 9-in. centers in the crown, and twenty 1-in. rods at
9-in. centers in the invert. In addition to the three standard types,
"<i>B</i>," "<i>C</i>," and "<i>D</i>," there were two sub-types which were used in
Type "<i>D</i>," and in conjunction with it wherever the thickness of the
center of the concrete arch became less than 1 ft. 6 in., measuring to
the outside of the metal lining. This thickness was one of the limits
used in laying out the lines and grades, and in general the arch was
not less than this. There were one or two short lengths, however,
where it was less, for, if the arch thickness requirement had been
adhered to, it would have resulted in a break of line or grade for the
sake of perhaps only a few feet of thin arch, and it was here that the
sub-types came into play.</p>

<p>Sub-type 1 was used where the arch was less than 1 ft. 6 in. thick
at the top. The extra reinforcement here consisted of 1-in. square
twisted rods, 16 ft. long, laid circumferentially in the crown at 10-in.
centers.</p>

<p>Sub-type 2 was used where the arch was less than 1 ft. 6 in. thick
at the side. The extra reinforcement here consisted of 1-in. square
twisted rods, 16 ft. long, laid circumferentially, at the side on which
the concrete was thin, at 10-in. centers. Very little of either of
these two sub-types was used. The entire scheme is shown graphically
and clearly on <a href="#PLATE_XXXVII">Plate XXXVII</a>.</p>

<p><i>Cross-Passage Lining.</i>&mdash;There are two main types of cross-passages:
Lined with steel plates, and unlined.</p>

<p>There is only one example of lining with steel plates, namely,
the most western one at Weehawken. This is built in rock which
carried so much water that, in order to keep the tunnels and the
passage dry, it was decided to build a concrete-lined passage, without
attempting to stop the flow of water, and within this to place a riveted
steel lining, not in contact with the concrete, but with a space between
the two. This space was drained and the water led back to the
shield chamber and thence to the Weehawken Shaft sump. The
interior of the steel lining is covered with concrete.</p>

<p>In the passages not lined with steel plates the square concrete
lining is rendered on the inside with a water-proof plaster. Each
of the passages is provided with a steel door.</p>

<p><i>Provisions in Concrete Lining for Surveys and Observations.</i>&mdash;The
long protracted discussion as to the provision for foundations in
these tunnels led to many surveys, tests, and observations, which
were carried out during the constructive period, and, as it was desired
to continue as many of these observations as possible up to and
after the time when traffic started, certain provisions were made in the

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>

concrete lining whereby these requirements might be fulfilled. The
chief points on which information was desired were as follows:</p>

<p>
The change in elevation of the tunnel,<br />
The change in lateral position of the tunnel,<br />
The change in shape of the tunnel,<br />
The tidal oscillation of the tunnel.<br />
</p>

<p>A detailed account of these observations will be found in another
paper on this work, but it may be said now that it was very desirable
to be able to get this information independently of the traffic as far
as possible, and therefore provision was made for carrying on the
observations from the side benches.</p>

<p>For studying the changes in level of the tunnel, a permanent
bench-mark is established in each tunnel where it is in the solid rock
and therefore not subject to changes of elevation; throughout the
tunnel, brass studs are set in the bench at intervals of about 300 ft.
A series of levels is run every month from the stable bench-mark on
each of these brass plugs, thus obtaining an indication of the change
of elevation that the tunnels have undergone during the month.</p>

<p>These results are checked on permanent bench-marks in the
subaqueous portion of the tunnels. These consist of rods, encased in
pipes of larger diameter, which extend down through the tunnel
invert into the bed-rock below the tunnel. Leakage is kept out by
a stuffing-box in the invert. By measuring between a point on these
rods where they pass through the invert and the tunnel itself a
direct reading of the change of elevation of the tunnel is obtained.
These measurements are taken at weekly intervals, and, as the tunnels
are subject to tidal influences, being lower at high tide than at low
tide, are always taken under the same conditions as to height of
water in the river. These permanent bench-marks are at Stations
209&nbsp;+&nbsp;05 and 256&nbsp;+&nbsp;02 (about 100 ft. on the shoreward side
of the river line in each case) in the South Tunnel, at Stations 220&nbsp;+&nbsp;00
and 243&nbsp;+&nbsp;86, also in the South Tunnel, and at Station 231&nbsp;+&nbsp;78
in the North Tunnel. In order to study the lateral change of position,
a base line was established on the side bench at each end
of each tunnel in the portion built through the solid rock.</p>

<p>At intervals of about 300 ft. throughout each tunnel, alignment pockets
are formed in the concrete arch, also above the bench, on the south
bench of the North Tunnel and the north bench of the South Tunnel. In
each pocket is placed a graduated and verniered brass bar, so that, when
the base line is projected on these bars, the lateral movement of the
tunnel can be read directly. As it was desirable to have as much
cross-connection as possible between the tunnels at the points where the
instruments were to be set up, five of the main survey stations were set
opposite each of the five cross-passages. Then, for the purpose of
increasing the cross-connection still further, pipes 6 in. in diameter
were put through from one tunnel to the other at axis level at Stations
220&nbsp;+&nbsp;60, 231&nbsp;+&nbsp;78, 234&nbsp;+&nbsp;64,
241&nbsp;+&nbsp;99, and 251&nbsp;+&nbsp;13, and a survey station was put
in opposite each one.</p>

<p>Points were established at Station 220&nbsp;+&nbsp;00, which is the point
of intersection for the curve on the original center line of the tunnel,
and also at Station 220&nbsp;+&nbsp;23, where the intersection of the track
center line comes in the North Tunnel. As it was desirable to have
the survey stations not much more than 300 ft. apart, so as to obtain
clear sights, other stations were established so that the distances between
survey stations were at about that interval.</p>

<p>For studying changes of shape in the tunnel, brass "diameter markers"
were inserted at each survey station in the concrete lining at the
extremities of the vertical and horizontal axes. These were pieces of
brass bar, &#8540; in. in diameter and 6 in. long, set in the concrete
and projecting &#8541; in. into the tunnel, so that a tape could be
easily held against the marker and read.</p>

<p>For obtaining the tidal oscillation of elevation of the tunnel,
recording gauges are attached to the invert of the tunnel at each of the
five permanent bench-marks referred to above in such a way that the
recording pencil of the gauge is actuated by the rod of the permanent
bench-mark. A roll of graduated paper is driven by clock-work below the
recording pencil which thus marks automatically the relative movement
between the moving tunnel and the stable rods. These have shown that in
the subaqueous part of the tunnel there is a regular tidal fluctuation
of elevation, the tunnel moving down as the tide rises, and rising again
when the tide falls. For an average tide of about 5 ft. the tunnel
oscillation would be about &#8539; in. Before the concrete lining was
placed, there was a tidal change in the shape of the tunnel, which
flattened about 1/64 in. at high tide. After the concrete lining was
placed, this distortion seemed to cease.

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span></p>

<p>The general design and plan of the work have been described, and before
giving any account of the contractor's methods in carrying it out, <a href="#TABLE_22">Table 22</a>,
showing the chief quantities of work in the river tunnels, is
presented.</p>

<h3>Methods of Construction.</h3>

<p>The following is an account of the methods used by the contractor
in carrying out the plans which have already been described. First,
it may be well to point out the sequence of events as they developed in
this work. These events may be divided into six periods.</p>

<blockquote><p><i>1.</i>&mdash;Excavation and Iron Lining: June, 1903, to November, 1906;</p>

<p><i>2.</i>&mdash;Caulking and grummeting the iron lining: November, 1906,
to June, 1907;</p>

<p><i>3.</i>&mdash;Surveys, tests and observations: April, 1907, to April, 1908;</p>

<p><i>4.</i>&mdash;Building cross-passages and capping pile bores: April, 1908,
to November, 1908;</p>

<p><i>5.</i>&mdash;Placing the concrete lining: November, 1908, to June, 1909;</p>

<p><i>6.</i>&mdash;Cleaning up and various small works: June, 1909, to November,
1909.</p></blockquote>

<p>The tunnels were under an average air pressure of 25 lb. per sq. in.
above normal for all except Periods 5 and 6, during which times there
was no air pressure in the tunnels.</p>

<p>All the work will be described in this paper except that under
Period 3 which will be found in another paper.</p>

<p><i>Period 1.&mdash;Excavation and Iron Lining, June, 1903, to November,
1906.</i>&mdash;<a href="#TABLE_23">Table 23</a> gives the chief dates
in connection with this period.</p>

<p><i>Manhattan Shield Chambers.</i>&mdash;The Manhattan shield chamber construction
will be first described. The Weehawken shield chambers
have been described under the Land Tunnel Section, as they are of
the regular masonry-lined Land Tunnels type, whereas the Manhattan
chambers are of segmental iron lining with a concrete inner lining.</p>

<p>During the progress of excavation, the location of the New York
shield chambers was moved back 133 ft., as previously described in the
"Land Tunnel" Section, and when the location had been finally decided,
there was a middle top heading driven all through the length
now occupied by the shield chamber. Narrow cross-drifts were taken
out at right angles to the top heading, and from the ends of these the
wall-plate headings were taken out. Heavy timbering was used, as
the rock cover was only about 6 ft., and the whole span to be covered
was 60 ft. The process adopted was to excavate and timber the north
side first, place the iron lining, and then excavate the south side, using
the iron of the north side as the supports for the north ends of the
segmental timbering of the south. The only incident of note was that
at 2:00 <span class="smcap">A.M.</span>, on October 20th, 1904, the rock at the west end of the
south wall-plate heading was pierced. Water soon flooded the workings,
and considerable disturbance was caused in the New York Central
Railroad yard above. The cavity on the surface was soon filled in,
but to stop the flow of mud and water was quite a troublesome job.</p>

<p>The excavation was begun on May 24th, 1904, and finished on May
15th, 1905. The segments were placed by an erector consisting of a
timber boom supported by cross-timbers running on car wheels on
longitudinal timbers at each side of the tunnel. Motion was transmitted
to the boom by two sets of tackle, and the heavy (5,000-lb.)
segments were easily handled. The erection of the lining was started
on February 4th, 1905, and finished on June 14th, 1905.</p>

<p>While the shield chambers were being excavated, bottom headings
were run along the lines of the river tunnels and continued until the
lack of rock cover prevented their being driven further. These were
afterward enlarged to the full section as far as possible. The typical
working force in the shield chambers was as follows:</p>

<p><i>Erection of Shields.</i>&mdash;The tunneling shields have been described
in some detail in the section of this paper dealing with the contractor's
plant. They consist essentially of two parts, the structural
steelwork and the hydraulic fittings. The former was made by the
Riter Conley Manufacturing Company, of Pittsburg, Pa., and put
up by the Terry and Tench Company, of New York City; the hydraulic
fittings were made and put in by the Watson-Stillman Company, of
New York City.</p>

<p>On the New York side, the shields were built inside the iron
lining of the shield chambers, hence no falsework was needed, as
the necessary hoisting tackle could be slung from the iron lining;
at Weehawken, however, the erection was done in the bare rock excavation,
so that timber falsework had to be used. The assembly and
riveting took about 2 weeks for each shield; the riveting was done
with pneumatic riveters, using compressed air direct from the tunnel
supply.</p>

<p>After the structural steel had been finished, the shields, which
had hitherto been set on the floor of the chambers in order to give
room for working over the top, were jacked up to grade; this involved
lifting a weight of 113 tons. While the hydraulic fittings were
being put in, the shields were moved forward on a cradle, built
of concrete with steel rails embedded, on which the shield was driven
for the length in which the tunnel was in solid rock.</p>

<p>The installation of the hydraulic fittings took from 4 to 6 weeks
per shield. The total weight of each finished shield was about 193
tons. The completed shield, as it appeared in the tunnel, is shown
by <a href="#PLATE_XXXVIII_Fig_1">Fig. 1, Plate XXXVIII</a>. The typical force working on shield
erection was as follows:</p>

<p>After the shield was finished and in position, the first two rings
of the lining were erected in the tail of the shield. These first
rings were then firmly braced to the rock and the chamber lining;
then the shield was shoved ahead by its own jacks, another ring
was built, and so on.</p>

<p>The description of the actual methods of work in the shield-driven
tunnels can now be given; this will be divided generally into
the different kinds of conditions met at the working face, for example,
Full Face of Rock, Mixed Face, Full Face of Sand and Gravel,
Under River Bulkhead, and Full Face of Silt.</p>

<p>The last heading is the one under which by far the longest length
of tunnel was driven, and, as not much has hitherto appeared descriptive
of the handling of a shield, through this material, considerable
space will be devoted to it.</p>

<p><i>Full Face of Rock.</i>&mdash;As was described when dealing with the
shield chambers, as much as possible of the rock excavation was done
before the shields were installed. On the New York side, about 146
ft. of tunnel was completely excavated, with 71 ft. of bottom headings
beyond that, and at Weehawken, 58 and 40 ft. of tunnel and
heading beyond, respectively. This was chiefly done to avoid handling
the rock through the narrow shield doors. Test holes were driven
ahead at short intervals to make sure that the rock cover was not
being lost, but, nevertheless, at Weehawken, on February 14th, 1905,
a blast broke through the rock and let the mud flow in, filling the
tunnel for half its height for a distance of 300 ft. from its face.</p>

<p>Throughout the rock section the shield traveled on a cradle of
concrete in which were embedded either two or three steel rails. In
the portion in which the whole of the excavation had been taken
out, it was only necessary to trim off projecting corners of rock. In
the portion in which only a bottom heading had been driven, the
excavation was completed just in front of the shield, the drilling
below axis level being done from the heading itself, and above that

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>

from the front sliding platforms of the shield. The holes were placed
near together and drilled short, and very light charges of powder
were used, so as to lessen the chance of knocking the shield about
too much. In this work the small shield doors hampered the work
greatly, and it might have been well to have provided a larger bottom
opening which could have been subdivided or partly closed when
soft ground was met; on the other hand, the quantity thus handled
was small, owing to the fact that the greater part of the rock was
excavated before the shields were installed.</p>

<p>The space outside the lining was grouted with a 1:1 mixture of
Portland cement and sand. Large voids were hand-packed with stone
before grouting. The details of grouting will be described later.</p>

<p>A typical working gang is given herewith. Two such gangs
were worked per shield per 24 hours, 10 hours per shift. All this
work was done under normal air pressure.</p>

<p>The duties of such a gang were as follows: The tunnel superintendent
looked after both shifts of one shield. The assistant or
"walking boss" had charge of all work in the tunnel on one shift.
The general foreman had charge of the labor at the face. The
electricians looked after repairs, extensions of the cables, and lamp
renewals. The pipefitters worked in both tunnels repairing leaks in
pipes between the power-house and the working faces, extending the
pipe lines, and attending to shield repairs, and in the latter work
the erector runner helped.</p>

<p>The drillers stuck to their own jobs, which were not subject to
interruption as long as the bottom headings lasted. One waterboy
and one powderboy served two tunnels. The muckers helped the iron
men put up the rings of lining, as well as doing their own work.
The iron men tightened bolts, whenever not actually building up iron.
The list does not include the transportation gang, which will be
described under its own heading.</p>

<p>The rate of progress attained was 4.2 ft. per day per shield where
most of the excavation had been done before, and 2.1 ft. where
none had been done before.</p>

<p>When the shields had got far enough away from the shield chamber,
and before rock cover was lost, the first air-lock bulkhead walls were
put in.</p>

<p><i>Air-Lock Bulkhead Walls.</i>&mdash;The specifications required these walls
and all their fittings to be strong enough to stand a pressure of 50 lb.
per sq. in. Accordingly, all the walls were of concrete, 10 ft. in thickness,
except the first two, which were 8 ft. in thickness, and grouted
up tight.</p>

<p>There were three locks in each bulkhead wall capable of holding
men, namely, the top or emergency lock which is set high in order
to afford a safe means of getting away in case of a flood; this lock
was used continuously for producing the lines and levels into the
tunnels. It was very small and cramped for this purpose, and a
larger one would have been better, both for lines and emergencies.
This lock was directly connected with the overhead platform (also
called for in the specifications) which ran the whole length of the
tunnels. Side by side, on the level of the lower or working platform
of the tunnel, were the man lock and the muck lock. In addition a
number of pipes were built in to give access to the cables and for
passing pipes, rails, etc., in and out.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span></p>

<p>After each tunnel was about 1,200 ft. ahead of the first walls, a
second wall was built just like the first, and no others were put in,
so that altogether there were eight walls. This second wall not only
gave an added safeguard to the tunnel but enabled the air pressure
at the working face to be divided between the two walls, and this
compression or decompression in stages, separated by a spell of walking
exercise, was found to be very good for the health of those
working in the air.</p>

<p><i>Mixed Face.</i>&mdash;When the rock cover became so thin that it was
risky to go on without the air pressure, the air pressure was turned
on, starting with from 12 to 18 lb., which was enough to stop the
water from the gravel on top of the rock. At first, when the surface
of the rock was penetrated, the soft face was held up by horizontal
boards braced from the shield until the shield was shoved. The braces
were then taken out and, as soon as the shield had been shoved, were
replaced by others. As the amount of soft ground in the face increased,
the system of timbering was gradually changed to one of
2-in. poling boards resting on top of the shield and supported at
the face by vertical breast boards, in turn held by 6 by 6-in. walings
braced both through the upper doors to the iron lining and from the
sliding platforms of the shield. The latter were in their forward
position before the shield was shoved, the pressure being turned off
and the exhaust valves opened just before the shove began. As the
shield went ahead, the platform jacks gradually exhausted and thus
held enough pressure on the face to keep it up. <a href="#Fig_17">Fig. 17</a> is a sketch
of this method. In driving through mixed ground a typical working
gang was about as follows:</p>

<p>The average rate of progress was 2.6 ft. per day.</p>

<p>In this case there were three such gangs, each on an 8-hour shift.</p>

<p><i>Full Face of Sand and Gravel.</i>&mdash;This condition of affairs was only
met at Weehawken. Two systems of timbering were used. In the
first system, <a href="#Fig_17">Fig. 17</a>, the ground was excavated 2 ft. 6 in. ahead of
the cutting edge, the roof being held by longitudinal poling boards,
resting on the outside of the skin at their back end and on vertical breast
boards at the forward end. When the upper part of the face was dry,
it was held by vertical breast boards braced from the sliding platform
and through the shield doors to cross-timbers in the tunnel; the
lower part, which was always wet, was held by horizontal breast boards
braced through the lower shield pockets to cross-timbers in the tunnel.
This system worked all right as long as the ground in the top was
sandy enough and had sufficient cohesion to allow the polings to be put
in, but, when the upper part was in gravel, thus making it impossible
to put in the longitudinal polings or the vertical breasting, the second
system came in. Here the excavation was only carried 1 ft. 3 in.
(half a shove) ahead of the cutting edge, and the longitudinal polings
were replaced by transverse boards supported by pipes which were
placed in the holes provided in the shield to accommodate some telescopic
poling struts which had been designed but not made. These
pipes acted as cantilevers, and were in two parts, a 2&frac12;-in. pipe wedged
tight into the holes and smaller pipes sliding inside them. After a
small section of the ground had been excavated, a board was placed
against it, one of the pipes was drawn out under it, and wedges were
driven between it and the board. These polings were kept below the
level of the hood, so that when the shield was shoved they would come
inside of it; in addition, they were braced with vertical posts from
the sliding platforms. The upper part of the face was held by
longitudinal breast boards braced from the sliding platform by vertical
"soldier" pieces. The lower part of the face was supported by vertical
sheet-piling braced to the tunnel through the lower doors. Sometimes
two rows of piling were used, but generally one, as shown in <a href="#Fig_17">Fig. 17</a>.
Notwithstanding the fact that the breasting was only 1 ft. 3 in. ahead
of the hood, the shield was moved its full stroke of 2 ft. 6 in., the
ground around the cutting edge of the hood being scraped away by men
working bars in the place from which the temporary breast boards at
the circumference had been removed. The back pressure on the
sliding platform jacks, when the exhaust valves were only partly open,
offered a good deal of resistance, and held the face as long as the
movement of the shield was continuous.

<p>On one occasion, when for some reason the shield was stopped with
the shove only partly done, and the exhaust valves had not been shut
off, the platforms continued to slide and allowed the face to collapse;
the shield platforms and doorways, however, caught the falling sand
and gravel and the flow choked itself.</p>

<p>As soon as the rock surface was penetrated and the sand and gravel
were met, which happened almost at the same time in the two
Weehawken Tunnels, the escape of air increased enormously, and it at
once became clear that it was impossible to keep enough air in the
two tunnels by the methods then in use, even when working the three
compressors, each capable of compressing 4,400 cu. ft. of free air per
min. at top speed. When the shields just entered the sand and gravel,
the face had been held by light breasting, without any special effort to
prevent the escape of air, but when it was found impossible to supply
enough air, a large amount of straw and clay was used in front of
the boards.</p>

<p>This cut down the escape, but, as much air was escaping through
the joints of the iron lining, these were plastered with Portland cement.
Even then, the loss was too great, therefore one tunnel was shut down
entirely and all the air was sent to the other. This allowed a pressure
of 10 lb. to be kept up in the working tunnel, and this, though less than
the head, was enough to allow progress to be made. In order to use
one tunnel as a drain for the other, the two faces were always kept
within 150 ft. of each other by working them alternately. The
timbered face was never grouted, though this would have reduced the
loss of air, as at the same time it would have decreased the progress
very much, and any one who saw the racing engines in the power-house,

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>

and realized that a breakdown of one of them would mean the
loss of the faces, was ready to admit that the quicker this particular
period was cut short, the better.</p>

<p>Above the sand and gravel lay the silt, and, when it showed in the
roof, the escape of air was immediately reduced and the two faces could
be worked simultaneously. Almost at the same time the piles supporting
the large warehouse, known as the Fowler Building, were met.
Although the face now took much less timber, the same system of
breast boards as had been used in the gravel was kept up, but in
skeleton form. They were set 2 ft. 6 in. ahead of the shield, however,
instead of 1 ft. 3 in., and the transverse roof poling boards were
replaced by longitudinals resting on the shield. The more piles in the
face the less timbering was done. The piles were cut into handy
lengths with axes and chisels.</p>

<p>All timbering was light compared with the weight of the ground,
but, as the shove took place as soon as the set was made, it served its
purpose. When a face was closed down the whole system was greatly
reinforced by braces from the shield, the face of which was closed by
the doors.</p>

<p>In driving through such a face the typical 8-hour shift gang was
about as follows:</p>

<p>The drillers were not kept on after the rock disappeared; a foreman
was added who divided his time between iron erection and mucking.</p>

<p>The average rate of progress in sand and gravel without piles was
5.1 ft. per day per shield. When piles and silt were met in the upper
part of the face, the speed increased to 7.0 ft. per day.</p>

<p><i>Passing Under River Bulkhead.</i>&mdash;At Weehawken no trouble was
found in passing under the river wall, as the bulkhead consisted of
only cribwork supported on silt, and, though the piles obstructed the
motion of the shield, they were easily cut out, and the cribwork itself
was well above the top of the shield.</p>

<p>On the New York side, however, conditions were not nearly as
good. The heavy masonry bulkhead was supported on piles and rip-rap,
as shown in <a href="#Fig_18">Fig. 18</a>. The line of the top of the shield was about 6 ft.
above the bottom of the rip-rap, the spaces between the stones of which
were quite open and allowed a free flow of water directly from the
river. As soon, therefore, as the cutting edge of the shield entered
the rip-rap there was a blow, the air escaping freely to the ground
surface behind the bulkhead and to the river in front of it. Clay
puddle, or mud made from the excavated silt, was used in large
quantities to plug up the interstices between the stone in the working
face, the air pressure being slightly greater than that needed to keep
out the water holding it in place. The excavation of the rip-rap was
a tedious affair, for it had to be removed one stone at a time and the
spaces between the newly exposed stones plugged with mud immediately.
One man stood ready with the mud while another loosened the stones
with a bar. When the shield had advanced its own length in the rip-rap,
another point for the escape of the air was exposed at the rear end
of the shield. This loss was closed at the leading end of the last ring
with mud and cement sacks.</p>

<p>As long as the shield was stationary it was possible, by using these
methods and exercising great care and watchfulness, to prevent
excessive loss of air; but, while the shield was being shoved ahead, the
difficulties were much increased, for the movement of the shield displaced
the bags and mud as fast as they were placed, and it was only
by shoving slowly and having a large number of men looking out for
leaks and stopping them up the instant they developed that excessive
loss of air could be prevented. In erecting the iron lining, as each
segment was brought into position, it was necessary to clean off the

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>

leading surface of the previous ring and the adjacent portion of the
tail of the shield; this was always accompanied by a slight "blow,"
and for some time the air pressure in the tunnel dropped from 25 to
20 lb., that is, from greater than the balancing pressure to less, every
time a segment was placed, and on two occasions the "blow" became
so great that the tunnel pressure was reduced considerably further,
and in consequence the water from the river rushed in and was not
stopped until it had risen about 4 ft. in the tunnel invert. On such
occasions the surface of the river was greatly disturbed, rising more
than 20 ft. in the air in a sort of geyser. A large quantity of grout
(about 2,500 bbl. of cement and a similar quantity of sand in the
North Tunnel and 1,000 bbl. in the South Tunnel) was used at this
point; it was forced through the tunnel lining immediately behind the
shield, greatly reducing the loss of air and helping to bind the rip-rap
together.</p>

<p>When the shield had traveled 25 ft. through the rip-rap, the piles
which support the bulkhead were met. One hundred of these which
were spaced at 3-ft. centers in each direction, were cut out of the path
of each shield in a distance of 35 ft. The presence of the piles caused
considerable extra labor, as each pile had to be cut into several pieces
with axes to enable it to be removed through the shield doors, otherwise
they presented no difficulties. It was not necessary to timber the
face, as the piles supported it most effectively.</p>

<p>When the river line had been passed, the "blow" still continued,
and as there was no heavy ground above the tunnel the light silt
was carried away into the water by the escaping air. At one time
the cover over the crown of the tunnel was reduced to such an extent
that for a distance of 30 ft. there was less than 10 ft. of very soft
silt, and in some places none at all. Therefore, the shield was
stopped and the air pressure reduced until it was less than the balancing
pressure; the blow then ceased, and about 28,000 cement bags
filled with mud were dumped into the hole (the location made it impossible
to dump them <i>en masse</i>from a scow). They were then
weighted down with rip-rap. This sealed the blow, and the work was
continued without any further disturbance from this source. Just
before the blow reached its maximum it was found that two of the
piles which had been encountered were directly in the path of one
of the proposed screw-piles. It was therefore decided to pull these,

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>

and this was done with two 40-ton hydraulic jacks supported by the
upper sliding platforms and acting on a horizontal timber which was
connected to the piles by tie-rods and chains. The working force
here was similar to that employed in the sand and gravel section
previously described.</p>

<p><i>In Full Face of Silt.</i>&mdash;A full face of silt was first met under the
New York Central Railroad freight yard on the New York side. Up
to this point the ground passed through had been either solid rock
or a mixed face of rock and gravel. In both of these the full excavation
had to be taken out before the shield could be shoved, and
the soft ground had needed timbering. When the rock, gravel, and
hardpan gave place to a full face of silt, the timber was removed,
all the shield doors were opened, and the shield was shoved into the
ground without any excavation being done by hand ahead of the
diaphragm. As the shield advanced, the silt was forced through the
open doors into the tunnel. After the work had gone on in this way
for some time, taking in about 90% of the full volume of the tunnel
excavation per foot forward, the air pressure was raised from 20 to
22 lb. The result was that the silt in the face got harder and
flowed less readily through the shield, and the amount taken in fell
to about 65% of the full volume. This manner of shoving at once
caused a disturbance on the surface and the railroad tracks above the
tunnel were raised, so that the pressure was lowered to 16 lb., then the
muck got softer and the full volume of excavation was taken in;
after a while the pressure was again raised to 20 lb.</p>

<p>The forcing of the shield through the silt resulted in a rising of
the bed of the river, the amount that the bed was raised depending
on the quantity of material brought into the shield.</p>

<p>If the whole volume of excavation was being brought in, the
surface of the bed was not affected; when about 50% was being
taken in, the surface was raised about 3 ft.; if the shield was being
driven blind, the bed was raised about 7 ft.</p>

<p>The number of open doors was regulated so as to take in the
minimum quantity of muck consistent with causing no surface disturbance.
On the average, in the North Manhattan Tunnel, all the
doors were open, but in the South Tunnel there were generally only
five or six out of the total nine.</p>

<p>In front of the bulkhead wall at Manhattan the tunnels were under

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>

Pier No. 72. This structure was supported on wooden piles, some
80 ft. or more in length, which came down below the tunnel invert.
The piles which lay directly in the path of the tunnels, with a few
exceptions, had been pulled. In driving the tunnels through this
section, great care had to be taken not to disturb the piles on either
side of the tunnels, as they supported a heavy trestle used in disposing
of the excavation from the open cut in the terminal yard. To avoid
such disturbance, a large portion of the total excavation had to be
taken through the shields.</p>

<p>The first shield which passed the river bulkhead was the south one
at Weehawken. As soon as this line was crossed the silt was found
to be much softer than behind the wall, in fact it was like a fluid
in many of its properties. The fluidity could be changed by varying
the tunnel air pressure; for example, when the air pressure was made
equal to the weight of the overlying material (water and silt), the
silt was quite stiff, and resembled a rather soft clay; but when the
air pressure was from 10 to 15 lb. per sq. in. lower, it became so
liquid that it would flow through a 1&frac12;-in. grout hole in the lining, in
a thick stream, at the rate of from 10 to 50 gal. per min. as soon as
the plug was taken out. This was the point to which the contractor
had long looked forward, as he expected to be able to close all his
shield doors and drive the rest of the way across without taking in a
shovelful of muck, as had just been done under the Hudson River,
on the South Tunnel of the Hudson and Manhattan Railroad Company's
Tunnels between Morton Street, New York City, and Hoboken,
N. J. The doors were shut and the shield was shoved; the tunnel at
once began to rise rapidly, notwithstanding that the heaviest possible
downward leads that the clearance between the iron and the shield
would allow were put on. At the same time, the pressures induced
in the silt by the shield shouldering the ground aside caused the
iron lining to rise about 2 in. as soon as the shield left it, and also
distorted it, the horizontal diameter decreasing and the vertical
diameter increasing by about as much as 1&frac14; in. An anxious discussion
followed these phenomena, as the effects had been so utterly
unexpected, and a good many different theories were advanced as
to the probable cause. It was thought that the hood of the shield
might have something to do with the trouble. The shield was stopped,
the hood removed, the doors were shut, and the driving continued.

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>

The same trouble was found, and it was impossible to keep to grade.
Work was stopped, and the question was thoroughly debated; finally,
on January 31st, 1906, the chief engineer directed that one of the
shield doors be opened as an experiment and 50% of the excavation
taken in.</p>

<p>The effect was instantaneous, the shield began to come down to
grade at once, and it soon became necessary to close the door partially
and reduce the quantity of muck taken in in order to prevent the
tunnel from getting below grade. The other troubles from distortion,
etc., ceased at the same time.</p>

<p>It was soon found that a powerful aid in the guidance of the
shield was thus brought to hand, for, if high, the shield could be
brought down by increasing the quantity of muck taken in, if low,
by decreasing it. From this time forward, the quantity of muck
taken in at each shove was carefully regulated according to
the position of the tunnel with regard to grade and the nature of
the ground. The quantity varied from nothing to the full volume
displaced by the tunnel, and averaged 33% of the latter.</p>

<p>To regulate the flow, the bottom middle door was fitted with two steel
angles behind which were placed 6 by 6-in. timbers. In this way the
opening could be entirely closed or one of any size left. The muck
flowed into the tunnel in a thick stream, as shown in <a href="#PLATE_XXXV_Fig_2">
Fig. 2, Plate XXXV</a>, and, by regulating the rate of shove it could be
made to flow just as fast as it could be loaded into cars.</p>

<p>In driving through the silt, the typical gang per shift of 8 hours
per shield was as follows:</p>

<p>Three such shifts were worked per day, and the air pressure
averaged 25 lb. per sq. in.</p>

<p>The increase in the number of pipefitters was due to the greatly
increased speed, and also the steadily increasing length of completed
tunnel. The three laborers in the erection gang spent their whole
time tightening bolts. The rate of progress in the silt under the
river per ring of 2&frac12; ft. was 3 hours 21 min., exclusive of all time
when work was actually suspended. For a considerable part of the
time only two 8-hour shifts were worked, owing to a shortage of
iron caused by the change in the design of the lining, whereby the
original lining was changed to a heavier one, and, as the work was
also stopped for experiments and observations, the average of the
actual total time, including all the time during which work was suspended,
was 5 hours 32 min. per ring, or 10.8 ft. per day.</p>

<p>The junction of the shields under the river was made as follows:
When the two shields of one tunnel, which had been driven from
opposite sides of the river approached within 10 ft. of each other,
the shields were stopped, a 10-in. pipe was driven between them, and
a final check of lines and levels was made through the pipe. Incidentally,
also, the first through traffic was established by passing a
box of cigars through the pipe from the Manhattan shield to that
from Weehawken. One shield was then started up with all doors
closed while the doors on the stationary shield were opened so that
the muck driven ahead by the moving shield was taken in through
the other one's doors. This was continued until the cutting edges
came together. All doors in both shields were then opened and the
shield mucked out. The cutting edges were taken off, and the shields
moved together again, edge of skin to edge of skin. The removal
of the cutting edge necessitated the raising of the pressure to 37 lb.
As the sections of the cutting edges were taken off, the space between
the skin edges was poled with 3-in. stuff. <a href="#Plate_XXXIX_Fig_1">Fig. 1, Plate XXXIX</a>,
is a view of the shields of the North Tunnel after being brought
together and after parts of the interior frames had been removed. When
everything except the skins had been removed, iron lining was built
up inside the skins, the gap at the junction was filled with concrete,
and long bolts were used from ring to ring on the circumferential
joint. Finally, the rings inside the shield skins were grouted.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span></p>

<p>In order to make clear the nature of the work done in building
these shield-driven tunnels in silt, a short description will be attempted,
this description falling into three main divisions, namely,
Shoving the Shield, Pushing Back the Jacks, and Erecting the Iron
Lining.</p>

<p><i>Shoving the Shield.</i>&mdash;This part of the work is naturally very important,
as the position of the shield determines within pretty narrow
limits the position of the iron built within it, hence the shield
during its forward movement has to be guided very carefully. On
this work certain instructions were issued for the guidance of the
foreman in charge of the shield. These instructions were based on
results of "checks" of the shield and iron's position by the engineering
corps of the Company, and comprised, in the main, two requirements,
namely, the leads that were to be got, and the quantity of
muck to be taken in. The "lead" is the amount that the shield must
be advanced further from the iron, on one side or the other, or on
the top or bottom, as measured from the front face of the last ring
of iron lining to the diaphragm of the shield. These leads are not
necessarily true leads from a line at right angles to the center line,
as the iron may have, and in fact usually does have, a lead of its
own which is known and allowed for when issuing the requirements
for the shove.</p>

<p>The foreman, knowing what was wanted, arranged the combination
of shield jacks which would give the required leads and the
amount of opening on the shield door which would give the required
amount of muck. To see how the shield was going ahead, a man
was stationed at each side at axis level and another in the crown.
Each man had a graduated rod on which the marks were so distinct
that they could be read by anyone standing on the lower platform.
These rods were held against the shield diaphragm, and,
as it advanced, its distance from the leading end of the last ring
could be seen by the man in control of the jack valves. If he found
that he was not getting the required leads, he could change the
combination of jacks in action. As the time of a shove was often
less than 10 min., the man had to be very quick in reading the rods
and changing the jacks. If it was found that extensive change in
the jack arrangement was wanted, the shove could be stopped by
a man stationed at the main hydraulic control valve; but, as any
such stoppage affected the quantity of muck taken in, it was not resorted
to unless absolutely necessary.</p>

<p>If the quantity of muck coming in was not as desired, a stop
had to be made to alter the size of the opening, and if, while this
was being done, the exhaust valves were not closed quite tight, the
silt pressure on the face of the shield would force it back against
the iron. This fact was sometimes taken advantage of when a full
opening did not let in the desired quantity, for the shield could be
shoved, allowed to return, and shoved again.</p>

<p>The time taken to shove in silt varied greatly with the quantity
of material taken in; for shoving and mucking combined, it averaged
66 min., with an average of 13 cu. yd. of muck disposed of, or about
5 min. per cu. yd. of material.</p>

<p><i>Pushing Back the Jacks.</i>&mdash;This was a simple matter, and merely
consisted in making the loose push-back connection to each jack
as it had to be sent back. Some of the jacks became strained and
bent, and had to be taken out and replaced. Where there was silt
pressure against the face of the shield, the hydraulic pressure had
to be kept on until the ring was erected. In such cases, only two
or three jacks could be pushed back at a time, and only after a
segment had been set in position, and the pressure taken on it, could
the next jack be pushed back, and so on around the ring. The time
between the finish of the shove (hydraulic pressure turned off) and
the placing of the first segment, was occupied in pushing back the
bottom jacks and cleaning dirt off the tail of the shield, and averaged
about 14 min.</p>

<p><i>Erecting the Iron Lining.</i>&mdash;As soon as the shove was over, the
whole force, when in silt, set to work at building up the iron and
then tightening the bolts so that the shield could be shoved again.
A section of the tunnel with bolting and working platform is shown
on <a href="#PLATE_XL">Plate XL</a>.

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span></p>

<p>In the early part of the work, when the ground was being excavated
ahead of the shield, the whole force, with the exception of
those working in front of the shield, was engaged in erecting the
iron, but, as soon as this was done, most of the men returned to the
mucking, and only the iron workers continued to tighten up bolts.
On the other sections, where the shield was shoved into the silt without
excavating ahead, as soon as the shove was completed, the whole
force was engaged in the erection of the iron and the tightening of the
bolts, until they were so tight that the shield could be shoved again
for another ring.</p>

<p>The iron was brought into the tunnel on flat cars, two segments
to the car, and was lifted from the car and lowered into the invert
of the shield by a block and fall and chain sling, as shown in <a href="#PLATE_XXXIX_Fig_2">
Fig. 2, Plate XXXIX</a>. The bottom three or four segments were pushed
around into position with the erector, the head simply bearing against
the longitudinal flange without being attached to the segment; the
upper segments, however, were, as shown in <a href="#PLATE_XXXVIII_Fig_2">
Fig. 2, Plate XXXVIII</a>, and <a href="#PLATE_XLI_Fig_1">Fig. 1, Plate XLI</a>,
attached to the erector, by using the expanding
bar and the erector head designed by Mr. Patrick Fitzgerald, the
Tunnel Superintendent. This was found to be a most convenient
arrangement.</p>

<p>The single erector attached to the center of the shield was able
to erect the iron as fast as it could be brought into the tunnel, and
even when the weight of the segments was increased 25% (from
2,060 to 2,580 lb.) it always proved equal to its task, although occasionally
one of the chains in the mechanism broke and delayed the
work for an hour or so; but the sum of all the delays from this
cause and from breaks and leaks in the hydraulic line only averaged
13 min. per ring. The operating valve which was first used was a
four-spindle turning valve, but this was replaced by a sliding valve
which was found to be much more satisfactory, both in ease of
operation and freedom from failure.</p>

<p>As the iron was put into place, two of the middle bolts in each
longitudinal flange and two in each circumferential one were pulled
as tight as possible, and the others put in loosely; then, as soon as
the ring was in position, as large a force as could be conveniently
worked at one time was engaged in tightening the bolts. The shape
of the tunnel depended on the thoroughness of the tightening of the
bolts, and the shield was never shoved until the bolts in all the longitudinal
flanges had been thoroughly tightened. In addition, all the
bolts in the circumferential flanges below the axis were tightened,
and at least three of the six in each segment above. After the
shield had been shoved ahead, the bolts were found to have slackened,
and, where the daily progress was four rings, or more, it was necessary
to have a small gang of men always at this work.</p>

<p>In order to get at the bolts, special platforms were necessary, and
throughout the greater part of the work, a traveling platform was
used. This enabled the men to reach handily all parts of the seven
leading rings. This platform was supported and moved forward on
wheels fixed on brackets to the tunnel, and was pulled forward by connecting
chains every time the shield was shoved. In the early part of
the work it was not possible to use platforms, because, in order to maintain
the correct circular shape of the iron lining, it was necessary
to put in temporary horizontal turnbuckles at axis level. These, however,
were very convenient for supporting the planks which were
used as a temporary bolting platform for the sides of the tunnel, and a
temporary platform resting on 6 by 6-in. timbers across the tunnel enabled
the bolts in the crown of the tunnel to be reached, while the
6 by 6-in. timbers were left in to support the emergency platform
previously described (<a href="#PLATE_XL">Plate XL</a>), which extended the entire length
of the tunnel.</p>

<p>The time taken to erect the iron lining became shorter and shorter
as the tunnel organization became more perfect and the force better
trained, so that, whereas, in the early part of the work, it frequently
took 6 hours to erect a ring, in the latter part, when the work was
nearing completion, it was a common occurrence to erect a ring in
30 min. The average time in the "heavy iron" section, which included
the greater part of the work under the river, was 1 hour 4
min. for the erection of the ring and 40 min. for tightening the bolts
after that had been completed, so that the total time spent by the
whole gang on erection and bolting averaged 1 hour 44 min. per ring,
exclusive of the time spent by the small gang which was always engaged
in tightening the bolts. The average time spent in erecting
and bolting, for the whole length of the tube tunnels, was 2 hours
15 min. per ring.</p>

<a href="#TABLE_26">26</a>, and <a href="#TABLE_27">27</a>, the following
symbols are used:</p>

<p><i>F</i>&mdash;Time between completion of mucking and putting in first
plate, spent in shoving the jacks back.</p>

<p><i>G</i>&mdash;In ordinary iron = the whole time spent on erection and
bolting. In heavy iron = the time between putting in the
first plate and placing the key only.</p>

<p><i>H</i>&mdash;Time between placing the key and starting the next shove,
spent by the whole gang in tightening bolts. In addition
to this, there was a small gang which spent its whole time at
this work.</p>

<p><i>I</i>&mdash;In <a href="#TABLE_24">Table 24</a> the first pair of

<span style="margin-left: 1.2em;">In <a href="#TABLE_26">Table 26</a>

Outside diameter of tunnel = 23 ft. 0 in.<br />
Inside diameter of tunnel = 21 ft. 2 in.<br />
Length of ring = 2 ft. 6 in.<br />
</p>

<p>In the "Ordinary Iron" section the time is divided between mucking
(which included the shoving and pushing back of the jacks) and
the erection time (which included the time spent by the whole gang
in tightening bolts). In the "Heavy Iron" section these times are
all separated into "Mucking," "Pushing Back Jacks," "Erecting,"
and "Bolting," and here the bolting time included only that spent
on bolts by the whole gang; in addition, there was a small gang engaged
solely in tightening bolts. The lost time is the average time
lost due to the break-down of hydraulic pipe lines, damaged jacks,
and broken erector chains. The erection time is separated for the
various kinds of rings, that is, straight ordinary rings, rings
containing No. 1 bore segments, rings containing No. 2 bore segments,
and taper rings, and it will be seen that, on the average, taper rings
took 22 min. (or 24%) more time to erect and to bolt than ordinary
ones, and that rings containing No. 2 bore segments took 14 min.
(or 15%) more.</p>

<p><i>Air Pressure.</i>&mdash;The air pressure varied from 17 to 37 lb. Behind
the river line it averaged 17 lb. and under the river 26 lb. Behind
the river lines the pressure was generally kept about equal to the
water head at the crown, except where at Weehawken, as previously
described, this was impossible.</p>

<p>In the silt the pressure was much lower than the hydrostatic head
at the crown, but if it became necessary to make an excavation ahead
of the shield, for example at the junction of the shields, the air pressure
required was about equal to the weight of the overlying material,
namely, the water and the silt, as the silt, which weighed from

<p>A &frac12;-in. air line was taken direct from the working chamber to
the recording gauges in the engine-room, which enabled the engine-room
force to keep a constant watch on the air conditions below. To
avoid undue rise of pressure, a safety valve was set on the air line
at each lock, set to blow off if the air pressure rose above that desired.
The compressor plant was ample, except, as before described, when
passing the gravel section at Weehawken.</p>

<p>Records were kept of the air supply, and it may be said here that
the quantity of free air per man per hour was in general between
1,500 and 5,000 cu. ft., though in the open gravel where the escape
was great it was for a time as much as 10,000 cu. ft. For more than
half the silt period it was kept between 3,000 and 4,000 cu. ft., but
when it seemed proved beyond doubt that any quantity more than
2,000 cu. ft. had no beneficial effect on health, no attempt was made
to deliver more, and on two separate occasions for two consecutive
weeks it ran as low as 1,000 cu. ft. without any increase in the number
of cases of bends.</p>

<p>The amount of CO<sub>2</sub> in the air was also measured daily, as the
specifications called for not more than 1 part of CO<sub>2</sub> per 1,000 parts
of air. The average ranged between 0.8 and 1.5 parts per 1,000, though
in exceptional cases it fell as low as 0.3 and rose to 4.0. The air
temperature in the tunnels usually ranged from 55&deg; to 60&deg; Fahr.,
which was the temperature also of the surrounding silt, though at
times, in the earlier parts of the work when grouting extensively in
long sections of the tunnel in rock, it varied from 85&deg; to 110&deg; Fahr.</p>

<p><i>Grouting.</i>&mdash;Grout of one part of Portland cement to one part of
sand by volume was forced outside the tunnel lining by air pressure
through 1&frac12;-in. tapped and plugged grout holes formed in each segment
for this purpose, wherever the ground was not likely to squeeze
in upon the metal lining as soon as this was erected. That is to
say, it was used everywhere up to the river line; between river lines it
was not used except at the New York bulkhead wall in order to fill voids
in the rip-rap, and at the point of junction of the shields where the
space between the metal lining and the shield skins outside it was
grouted. Cow Bay sand was used, and it had to be screened to remove
particles greater than 1/10 in. in diameter, which would choke the valves.

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span>

For later grouting work, namely, in the top of the concrete lining
inside the metal lining, Rockaway Beach sand was used. This is
very fine, and did not need screening; it cost more, but the saving
of screening and the non-blocking of valves, etc., resulted in a saving.</p>

<p>The grout was mixed in a machine shown in <a href="#PLATE_XLI_Fig_2">Fig. 2, Plate XLI</a>,
which is a view of the grouting operation.</p>

<p>The grout pipes were not screwed directly into the tapped hole
in the segments, but a pipe containing a nipple and valve was screwed
into the grout hole and the grout pipe screwed to the pipe. This
prevented the waste of grout, enabled the valve to be closed and the
grout pipe disconnected, and the pipe to be left in position until the
grout had set. In the full rock section, 20 or 30 rings were put in
without grouting; then the shield was stopped, the last two or three
rings were detached and pulled ahead by the shield, a masonry stop-wall
was built around the outside of the last ring left in, and the
whole 20 or 30 rings were grouted at one time. In the landward silt
and gravel each ring had to be grouted as soon as the shield had left
it, in order to avoid the flattening caused by the weight coming on
the crown while the sides were as yet unsupported. The grout was
prevented from reaching the tail of the shield by plugging up the
space with empty cement bags, assisted by segmental boards held
against the face of the leading ring by U-shaped clamps, fitting over
the front circumferential flange of the ring and the boards, and tightened
by wedges. The air pressure varied between 70 and 100 lb. per
sq. in. above normal.</p>

<p>The force consisted of one pipe-fitter and one or two laborers
employed part of their time. When a considerable length was being
grouted at a time, as in the full rock section, many laborers were employed
for a short period.</p>

<h3>Transportation and Disposal.</h3>

<p>The transportation and disposal will be described under the following
headings:</p>

<p>
Receipt and Unloading of Materials,<br />
Surface Transportation,<br />
Tunnel Transportation,<br />
Disposal.<br />

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Receipt and Unloading of Materials.</i>&mdash;At the Manhattan Shaft
the contractor laid a spur siding into the yard from the freight
tracks of the New York Central Railroad, which immediately adjoins
the yard on the west. There was also wharfage on the river
front about 1,500 ft. away.</p>

<p>At the Weehawken Shaft there were four sidings from the Erie
Railroad and one from the West Shore Railroad. Access to the river
was gained by a trestle direct from the yard, and Baldwin Avenue
adjoined the yard.</p>

<p>All the iron lining arrived by railroad. It was unloaded by derricks,
and stacked so that it was convenient for use in the tunnel.
The Manhattan derricks were a pair of steel ones with 39-ft. booms,
worked by a 30-h.p., 250-volt, electric motor. There was also a stiff-leg
derrick with 50-ft. boom, on a platform near the shaft, which was
worked by a 40-h.p., 250-volt motor. At Weehawken there were two
45-ft. boom, stiff-leg derricks of 2 tons capacity, one worked by a 42-h.p.
Lidgerwood boiler and engine, and the other by a 25-h.p., 250-volt,
electric motor. These derricks were set on elevated trestles
near the Erie Railroad sidings. There was a 50-ft. stiff-leg derrick
with a 70-h.p. Lidgerwood boiler and engine near the cement warehouse
on the West Shore Railroad.</p>

<p>The storage area for iron lining was 1,800 sq. ft. at Manhattan
and 63,000 sq. ft. at Weehawken; the maximum quantity of lining in
storage at any one time was 150 rings at Manhattan and 1,200 rings
at Weehawken.</p>

<p>The cement, which was issued and sold by the Company to the
contractor, was kept in cement warehouses; that at the New York
side was at Eleventh Avenue and 38th Street, or some 1,200 ft. from
the shaft, to which it was brought by team; that at Weehawken was
adjacent to the shaft, with a 2-ft. gauge track throughout it and
directly connected with the shaft elevator.</p>

<p><i>Surface Transportation.</i>&mdash;In the early days the excavation was
handled in scale-boxes of 1 cu. yd. capacity which were hoisted up
the shafts by a derrick, but, when the iron period began, two-cage
elevators were put in at each shaft. They were worked by a single,
friction-drum, Lidgerwood, steam hoisting engine of 40 h.p.</p>

<p>All materials of construction were loaded on cars on the surface
at the point where they were stored, and hauled on these to the elevators,

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span>

sent down the shaft, and taken along the tunnels to the desired
point without unloading.</p>

<p>The narrow-gauge railway on the surface and in the tunnel was
of 2-ft. gauge with 20-lb. rails. About 70 flat cars and 50 mining
cars were used at each shaft. On the surface at Manhattan these were
moved by hand, but at Weehawken, where distances were greater,
two electric locomotives on the overhead trolley system were used.</p>

<p><i>Tunnel Transportation.</i>&mdash;The mining cars shown in <a href="#Fig_19">Fig. 19</a> were
of 1&frac14; cu. yd. capacity. The short wheel base and unbalanced loading
caused a good many upsets, but they were compact, easily handled,
and could be dumped from either side or end.</p>

</div>

<p>The flat cars shown in <a href="#Fig_20">Fig. 20</a> were of 3 tons capacity, and could
hold two tunnel segments. As the working face was down grade
from the shafts, the in-bound cars were run by gravity. For out-bound
cars a cable haulage system was used, consisting of double-cylinder,
Lidgerwood, single friction-drum, hoisting engines (No. 32)
of 6 h.p., with cylinders 5 in. in diameter and 6 in. stroke and drums
10 in. in diameter. These were handily moved from point to point,
but, as there was no tail rope, several men had to be used to pull the
cable back to the face. After the second air-lock bulkhead walls
had been built, a continuous-cable system, worked electrically, was
put in each tunnel between the first and second air-locks.

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span></p>

<p>The engine consisted of an electric motor driving a 3-ft. 6-in.
drum hoist around which a &frac34;-in. steel wire cable passed three times.
The cable was led around a sheave, down the tunnel on the right side
of the in-bound track, and returned on the left side of the out-bound
track. It was then carried around a set of sheaves, where a tension
of 1,000 lb. was supplied by a suspended weight which acted on a
sheave with a sliding axle on the tension carriage. The cable was
supported throughout its length on 8-in. pulleys set in the floor at
50-ft. intervals. All the guide sheaves were 36 in. in diameter.</p>

<p>Each car was attached to the cable by a grip at its side. This
was fastened and unfastened by hand, but was automatically released
just before reaching the turn in the cable near each lock. This

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span>

system could haul without difficulty an unbalanced load of 10 muck
cars, spaced 100 ft. apart, up a 2% grade. The cable operated over
about 1,000 ft. of tunnel, the motor being placed at the top of the
grade. The driving motor was of the semi-armored, 8-pole, series-wound
type, rated at 25 h.p., 635 rev. per min., and using direct
current at 220 volts. The speed of handling the cars was limited
by their having to pass through the air-locks on a single track. As
many as 106 cars have been hauled each way in one 8-hour shift.</p>

<p><i>Disposal.</i>&mdash;At Manhattan the tunnel muck was carried from the
elevator over the upper level of the yard trestle and dumped into
bins on the 33d Street side, whence it was teamed to the public dump
at 30th Street and North River. At Weehawken the rock excavation
was removed by the Erie Railroad on flat cars on which it was
dumped by the tunnel contractor, but all the silt muck was teamed
away to some marshy ground where dumping privileges were obtained.</p>

<p>The typical forces employed on transportation were as follows:</p>

<p><i>Pumping.</i>&mdash;The water was taken out of the invert by a 4-in. blow-pipe
which was always kept up to a point near the shield and discharged
into the sump near the shaft.</p>

<p>When the air pressure was removed and the blow-pipe device,
consequently, was unavailable, small Cameron pumps, driven by compressed
air, and having a capacity of about 140 gal. per hour, were
used, one being set up wherever it was necessary to keep the invert
dry; for example, at points where caulking was in progress.</p>

<p><i>Lighting.</i>&mdash;The tunnels were lighted by electricity, the current
being supplied, at a pressure of 250 volts, from the dynamos in the
contractor's power-house.</p>

<p>Two 0000 wire cables were used as far as the second air-locks,
about 1,650 ft. from the power-house, on each side; and beyond that
point, to the junction of the shields (about 1,750 ft.), 00 and 0 wires
were used. These cables also carried the current for the cable haulage
system. Two rows of 16-c.p. lamps, provided with reflectors, were
used in each tunnel; one row was along the side just above the axis,
with the lights at about 30-ft. intervals; the other along the crown,
with the lamps halfway between the side lamps, also at 30-ft. intervals.
At points where work was in progress three groups of 5
lights each were used. The tunnels as a whole were well lighted, and
in consequence work of all kinds was much helped.</p>

<p><i>Period No. 2.</i>&mdash;<i>Caulking and Grummettng.</i>&mdash;<i>November, 1906, to
June, 1907.</i>&mdash;After the metal lining had been built completely across
the river in both tunnels, the work of making it water-tight was
taken up. This consisted in caulking into the joints between the
plates a mixture of sal-ammoniac and iron borings which set up into
a hard rusty mass, and in taking out each bolt and placing around
the shank under the washer at each end a grummet made of yarn

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span>

soaked in red lead. These grummets were made by the contractor on
the works, and consisted of three or four strands of twisted hemp
yarn, known as "lath yarn," making up a rope-like cross-section about
&frac14; in. in diameter. Usually, one of these under each washer was
enough, but in wet gravel, or where bolts were obliquely in the bolt-holes,
two were used at each end. After pulling the grummets in, all
the nuts were pulled up tight by wrenches about 3 ft. long, with two
men on one wrench. Bolts were not passed as tight unless the nut
resisted the weight of an average man on a 2&frac12;-ft. wrench.</p>

<p>Before putting in the caulking mixture, the joints were carefully
scraped out with a special tool, cleaned with cotton waste, and washed
with a stream of water. The usual mixture for sides and invert was
about 2 lb. of sal-ammoniac and 1 lb. of sulphur to 250 lb. of iron
filings or borings. In the arch, 4 lb. of sal-ammoniac and 3 lb. of
sulphur to 125 lb. of filings was the mixture. A small hand-hammer
was used to drive the caulking tool, but, in the sides and invert, air
hammers were used with some advantage. The success of work of this
kind depends entirely on the thoroughness with which the mixture is
hammered in; and the inspection, which was of an exceedingly monotonous
nature, called for the greatest care and watchfulness on the
part of the Company's forces, especially in the pocket iron, where
each bolt had to be removed, the caulking done at the bottom of the
pockets put in, the bolts replaced; and the rest of the pockets filled.
The results have been satisfactory, as the leakage under normal air
and prior to placing the concrete averaged about 0.14 gal. per lin. ft.
of tunnel per 24 hours, which is about 0.0035 gal. per lin. ft. of joint
per 24 hours. With each linear foot of joint is included the leakage
from 1.27 bolts. Afterward, when the concrete lining was in, the
leakage was found to be about 0.05 to 0.06 gal. per lin. ft. of tunnel
per 24 hours, which compares favorably with the records of other
lined tunnels. The typical gang employed on this work was as follows:</p>

<p>The average amount of caulking and grummeting done per shift
with such a gang was (with pocketless grooves), 348 lin. ft. of joint
and 445 bolts grummeted; and in pocket iron: 126 lin. ft. of joint and
160 bolts grummeted.</p>

<p>The caulking and grummeting work was finished in June, 1907,
this completing the second period.</p>

<p><i>Period No. 3.</i>&mdash;<i>Experiments, Tests, and Observations.</i>&mdash;<i>April, 1907,
to April, 1908.</i>&mdash;The third period, that of tests and observations in
connection with the question of foundations, is dealt with in another
paper. It occupied from April, 1907, to November, 1908. The results
of the information then gathered was that it was not thought advisable
to go on with the foundations.</p>

<p><i>Period No. 4.</i>&mdash;<i>Capping Pile Bores, Sinking Sumps, and Building
Cross-Passages.</i>&mdash;<i>April, 1908, to November, 1908.</i>&mdash;In order to reduce
the leakage from the bore segments to the least possible amount before
placing the concrete lining, it was decided to remove the plugs and
replace them with flat cover-plates; these have been described before,
together with the filling of Bore Segments No. 2 with mortar to
reduce the leakage around the distance piece.</p>

<p>During this period the turnbuckles to reinforce the broken plates
were put in, and the sump sunk at the lowest point of the tunnel.
These sumps have been described in a previous part of this paper; they
were put down without trouble. As much as possible of the concrete
lining was put in before the lining castings were taken into the tunnel,
as the space inside was very restricted. The first lining casting was
bolted to the flat flanges of the sump segment, the bolts holding the
latter to the adjacent segments were removed, and the whole was forced
down with two of the old shield jacks, taking a bearing on the tunnel.
The two together exerted a pressure of about 150 tons. The plugs in
the bottom of the sump segment were taken out, and pipes were put in,
through which the silt squeezed up into the tunnel and relieved the
pressure on the sump segment.

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span></p>

<p>If the silt did not flow freely, a water-jet was used. The sump was
kept plumb by regulating the jacks. In this way the sump was sunk,
adding lining sections one by one, and finally putting on the top
segment, which was composed of three pieces.</p>

<p>The time taken to sink one sump was about 4 days, working one
8-hour shift per day, and not counting the time taken to set up the
jacks and bracing. The sinking of each section took from 4 to 6
hours. The air pressure was 25 lb. and the hydrostatic head 41 lb.
per sq. in. The force was 1 assistant superintendent at $6.00 per day,
1 foreman at $4.50, and 6 laborers at $3.00 per day.</p>

<p><i>Cross-Passages.</i>&mdash;It was during this period that the five cross-passages
previously mentioned were built. In the case of those in the
rock, careful excavation was needed so as to avoid breaking the iron
lining. Drilling was done from both ends, the holes were closely
spaced, and about 2 ft. 6 in. deep, and light charges of powder were
used. The heading, 5 by 7 ft. in cross-section, was thus excavated in
five lengths, with 24 holes to a length, and about 23 lin. ft. of hole per
yard. About 5.3 lb. of powder per cu. yd. was used. The sides, top,
and bottom were then drilled at a very sharp angle to the face and the
excavation was trimmed to the right size. This widening out took
about 7&frac12; ft. of hole per cu. yd., and 0.9 lb. of powder.</p>

<p>In the passages in silt the excavation had to be 12 ft. wide and
13 ft. 8 in. high to give enough room inside the timbers. The plates at
one end of the passage were first removed. An air pressure of 17 lb.
was carried, which was enough to keep the silt from squeezing in and
yet left it soft enough to be chopped with a spade.</p>

<p>A top heading, of full width and 6 ft. 8 in. high, was first taken
out, and the roof was sheathed with 2-in. boards held by 10 by 10-in.
head trees at 3-ft. centers, with 10 by 10-in. side trees. The lower 7 ft.
of bench was then taken out, a tight floor of 6 by 6-in. cross-timber
was put in, and also longer side trees, the head trees being temporarily
held by two longitudinal 10 by 10-in. stringers blocked in place. The
bulk of the space between the side trees was filled with 10 by 10-in.
posts and blocking. The plates at the other end of the passage were
then taken out from the other tunnel.</p>

<p>After the excavation was out, the outer reinforced concrete lining
was built. Rough forms were used, as the interior surfaces of the
passages were to be rendered with a water-proofing cement. A few

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span>

grout pipes were built in, and all voids outside the concrete were
grouted. Grouting was also done through the regular grout holes of
the metal lining around the openings.</p>

<p>In the case of the most westerly of the cross-passages at Weehawken,
which was in badly seamed rock carrying much water, a steel inter-lining,
rather smaller than the concrete, was put in. The space between
the concrete and the steel was left open, so that water coming through
the concrete lining was stopped by the steel plate. This water was led
back to the shield chamber in a special drain laid in the bench of the
river tunnel and behind the ducts. From the shield chamber the
water ran with the rest of the drainage from the Weehawken Land
Tunnels to the Weehawken Shaft sump.</p>

<p><i>Period No. 5.</i>&mdash;<i>Placing the Concrete Lining.</i>&mdash;<i>November, 1908, to
June, 1909.</i>&mdash;During the fifth period the concrete lining was put in.
This lining was placed in stages, as follows: First, the invert; second,
the duct bench; third, the arch; fourth, the ducts; and fifth, the face
of the bench. This division can be seen by reference to <a href="#Fig_21">Fig. 21</a>.</p>

<p>All the work was started on the landward ends and carried toward
the middle of the river from both sides. Except where the Weehawken
force passed the lowest point of the tunnel, which is at Station 241 or
nearly 900 ft. to the west of the middle of the river, all the work was
down grade.</p>

<p>Before any concrete was placed, the surface of the iron was cleaned
with scrapers and wire brushes, and washed with water. Any leaks in
the caulking and grummeting (finished by June, 1907, and therefore
all more than 12 months old) were repaired. All the grout hole plugs
were examined, and the plugs in any leaking ones were taken out,

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span>

smeared with red lead, and replaced. The leakage in the caulking was
due to the fact that the tunnel had been settling slightly during the
whole 12 months of pile tests, and, therefore, had opened some of the
joints. After the caulking had been repaired and the surface
thoroughly cleaned, the flanges were covered with neat cement (put
on dry or poured on in the form of thick grout) just before the concrete
was placed.</p>

<p><i>Invert Concrete.</i>&mdash;The form used for the landward type of
concrete, that is, the one with a middle drain, consisted of a frame
made of a pair of trussed steel rails on each side of the tunnel and
connected at intervals with 6 by 6-in. cross-timbers; two "wing forms"
were hung from this frame by adjustable arms. These wings formed the
curved sides of the invert, the lip, and the form for the middle drain.
The whole form was supported on three wheels, two on the rear end
running on a rail laid on the finished concrete, and the third in front
attached to the frame by a carriage and running on a rail temporarily
laid on the iron lining. The form was braced from the iron lining by 6
by 6-in. blocks.</p>

<p>For the soft-ground type of invert, namely, the one without the middle
drain, a form of the same general type was used, except that the form
for the middle drain was removed. After the form had been in use for
some time, "key pieces" (made of strips of wood about 1 ft. 3 in. in
length and 3 by 3 in. in cross-section) were nailed circumferentially on
the under side of the wings at 2-ft. intervals. This was done because,
at the time, it was not known whether ballasted tracks or some form of
rigid concrete track construction would be adopted, and, if the latter,
it was desirable not to have the surface smooth.</p>

<p>The concrete was received in cars at the rear end of the form and
dumped on a temporary platform. It was then loaded into wheel-barrows
on the runways, as shown in <a href="#Fig_22">Fig. 22</a>. The concrete was
thrown from the barrows into the invert, where it was spaded and
tamped.</p>

<p>In cases where there was steel-rod reinforcement, the concrete was first
brought up to the level of the underside of these rods, which came
between the wings; the rods were laid in place, and then more concrete
was placed over the rods and brought up to the level of the bottom of
the wings. Where there was no reinforcement, the concrete was brought up
in one lift.

<p>After this was finished, the concrete behind the wings was placed,
thoroughly spaded and tamped, and, where there were longitudinal
reinforcing rods, these were put in at their proper level. Where there
were circumferential rods, the 16-ft. rods had already been put in when
the lower part of the concrete was placed. As the invert was being
finished off, the 8-ft. rods were embedded and tied in position.</p>

<p>The longitudinal rods were held in place at the leading end of each
length of arch by the wooden bulkhead, through which holes were
drilled in the proper position. At the rear end they were tied to the
rods projecting from the previous length. The quantity of water used
in mixing the invert concrete needed very nice adjustment; if too wet,
the middle would bulge and rise when the weight of the sides came on
it; and, if too dry, it would not pack properly between the flanges of
the iron lining. The difficulties as to this were often increased by the
flow of accumulated leakage water from the tunnel behind on the
concrete while it was being put in. To prevent this, a temporary dam
of sand bags was always built across the last length of finished invert
concrete before beginning a new length. A sump hole, about 4 by 1 ft.
and 1 ft. deep, was left every 800 ft. along the tunnel, and a small
Cameron pump was put there to pump out the water.</p>

<p>The invert forms were left in place about 12 hours after the pour
was finished. The average time taken to fill a length of 30 feet was
7 hours, the form was then left 12 hours, and it took 2 hours to set it
up anew. The total time for one length, therefore, was 21 hours, equal
to 34 ft. per 24 hours. At one place, a 45-ft. form was used, and this
gave an average speed of 45 ft. per 24 hours.</p>

<p>An attempt was made to build the invert concrete without forms
(seeing that a rough finish was desired, as previously explained, to form
a key for possible sub-track concrete), but it proved a failure.</p>

<p>The typical working force (excluding transport) was as follows:</p>

<p>The average time taken to lay a 30-ft. length of invert was 7 hours;
the two spaders remained one hour extra, smoothing off the surface.</p>

<p>For setting the form, the force was:</p>

    </tr>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span></p>

<p>The average time taken to erect a form was 2 hours, 1 carpenter
and 1 helper remaining until the concrete was finished.</p>

<p><i>Duct Bench Concrete.</i>&mdash;The duct bench (as described previously) is
the portion of the concrete on which the ducts are laid. The exact
height of the steps was found by trial, so as to bring the top of the
ducts into the proper position with regard to the top and the face
of the bench.</p>

<p>Both kinds of duct bench forms were of the same general type. A drawing
of one of them is shown on <a href="#PLATE_XLII">Plate XLII</a>. The form consisted of a skeleton
framework running on wheels on a track at the level of the temporary
transportation tracks. The vertical faces of the steps were formed by
boards supported from the uprights by adjustable arms. The horizontal
surfaces were formed by leveling off the concrete with a shovel at the
top of the vertical boards. Where the sheets of expanded metal used for
bonding came at a step, the lower edge of the boards forming the back of
the step was placed 1 in. above the one forming the front of it; but,
when the expanded metal came in the middle of a step, a slot 1 in. wide
was left at that point to accommodate it.</p>

<p>A platform was formed on the top of the framework for the form, and on
this a car forming a sort of traveling stage was run. There was ample
room to maintain traffic on a single track through the form. A
photograph of the form is shown in <a href="#PLATE_XLIII_Fig_1">Fig. 1, Plate XLIII</a>.</p>

<p>The concrete, for the most part, was received at the form in &frac34;-cu.
yd. dumping buckets. The buckets were lifted by the rope from a
small hoisting engine. This rope passed over a pulley attached to the
crown of the tunnel and dumped into the traveling stage on the top
of the form. In this the concrete was moved along to the point where
it was to be deposited, and there it was thrown out by shovels into the
form below. For a portion of the period, while the duct bench concrete
was being laid, it was not necessary to maintain a track for
traffic through the form and, during that period, the concrete for the
lower step was placed from below the form, the concrete being first
dumped on a temporary stage at the lower track level.</p>

<p>Owing to the horizontal faces of the steps being uncovered, there
was a tendency for the concrete there to rise when concrete was placed
in the steps above. For this part of the work, also, it was necessary
to see that the concrete was not mixed too wet, for, when that was the
case, the concrete in the upper steps was very apt to flow out at the
top of the lower one. At the same time, there was the standing objection
to the mixture being too dry, namely, the responsibility of getting
a sufficient amount of spading and tamping done. Particulars of the
exact quantity of water used are given later in describing "Mixing."

<p>In the section of the tunnel in which there were circumferential
reinforcement rods in the duct bench, the rods were in place before the
laying commenced, as they had been placed with the invert concrete.
The circumferential reinforcing rods in the arch came down into the
upper part of the duct bench concrete; these rods were put in position
and tied to the iron lining in the crown at the same time as the duct
bench concrete was being finished off. Openings for the manholes were
left in the duct bench at the regular stationing.</p>

<p>The average time taken to fill a length of 35 ft. was about 6 hours;
the form was then left in position for about 8 hours&mdash;usually enough
to let the concrete set properly&mdash;and then moved ahead; it then took
about 3 hours to set it up again ready to continue work. The total
time for a length, therefore, was about 17 hours, equal to an average
progress of about 49 ft. per day. The average force engaged in duct
bench concrete (not including transport) was:</p>

<p><i>Arch Concrete.</i>&mdash;By far the greater part of the arch work was put
in with traveling centers before the face of the bench was built, in
which case the whole of the arch was built at once. A short length of
arch at each end of the tunnel was built after the face of the bench, in
which case the haunches or lower 5 ft. were laid first and the upper
part of the arch later.</p>

<p>The first traveling centers were used on the New York side, and
were 50 ft. long. The laggings were of 4-in. yellow pine, built up in
panels 10 ft. long and 16 in. wide for the sides, and solely longitudinal
lagging 5 ft. long for the key.</p>

<p>It was pretty certain that the results to be obtained from forms
of such a length would not be satisfactory, and this was pointed out
to the contractor, who, however, obtained permission to use them on
trial. Grout pipes were built in, as it was not likely that the concrete
could be packed tightly into the upper part of the lining.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span></p>

<p>After about 300 lin. ft. of arch had been built with these forms, a
test hole was cut out and large voids were found, and, to confirm this,
another hole was cut, and similar conditions observed.</p>

<p>The results were so unsatisfactory that orders were given that the
use of longitudinal key lagging should be discontinued, and cross or
block lagging used instead. These block laggings were 6 in. in length
(in the direction of the tunnel) and 2 ft. in width; at the same time, the
system of grout pipes was changed. This will be described later under
"Grouting." It was soon found that with block lagging a better job
could be made of packing the concrete up into the keys, but the time
taken to "key up" a 50-ft. length was so great that the rest of the arch
had set by the time the key was finished. Despite a lot of practice,
this was the case, even in the unreinforced type. When the reinforcing
rods were met, the time for keying up became still greater, and therefore
the contractor was directed to shorten the forms to 20-ft. lengths.
A typical working force for a 50-ft. length was:</p>

    </tr>
</table>

<p>Details of the 20-ft. forms are shown on <a href="#PLATE_XLIV">Plate XLIV</a>. The
lower 4 ft. of lagging was built on swinging arms, which could be
loosened to allow the centers to be dropped and moved ahead. The
rest of the lagging was built up in panels 10 ft. long and 1 ft. 4 in.
high. The ribs rested on a longitudinal timber on each side; these
were blocked up from the top step of the duct bench concrete. When
the form was set, or when it was released, it was moved ahead on
rollers placed under it.</p>

<p>The concrete was received at the form in &frac34;-cu. yd. dumping buckets;
from the flat cars on which they were run, these were hoisted to the
level of the lower platform of the arch form. At this level the concrete
was dumped on a traveling car or stage, and moved in that to the point
on the form where it was to be placed. For the lower part of the arch,
the concrete was thrown directly into the form from this traveling
stage, but, for the upper part, it was first thrown on the upper platform
of the arch. The hoisting was done by a small Lidgerwood compressed-air
hoister, and set up on an overhead platform across the tunnel. The
pulley over which the cable from the hoister passed was attached to the
iron lining near one end of the form, and the traveling stage ran back
from the arch form on a trailer, shown on <a href="#PLATE_XLIV">Plate XLIV</a>. When it was
impossible to hang a pulley&mdash;owing to the concrete arch having been
built at the point where the trailer stood&mdash;an <b>A</b>-frame was built on the
trailer, and the pulley was attached to that.</p>

<p>In laying the lower part of the arch, about 1 ft. of lagging (including
the swinging arms) was first set, the other panels being pulled
up toward the top of the arch. When that was filled, the next panel
above was lowered into place, and the work continued. As the concrete
rose toward the key, it was packed up to a radial surface, so that
the arch would not be unduly weakened if the sides set before the key
was placed. All the time, great care was taken to see that the concrete
was carefully packed into the segments of the metal lining.
The quantity of water used in the concrete was carefully regulated,
more being used in the lower than in the upper parts of the arch.</p>

<p>In places where there were no reinforcing rods, the width of the
concrete key was the length of the block lagging, namely, 2 ft. Where
there was circumferential reinforcement, the key had to be more than
5 ft. wide, in order to take the 5-ft. closure rods used in the key. This
naturally increased the time of keying very much. On the places
where the 5-ft. longitudinal laggings were used, it was impossible to
fill the flanges of the metal lining much higher than their undersides.</p>

<p>As the concrete used in the key had to be much drier than that used
elsewhere, it was not easy to get a good surface. This trouble was overcome
by putting a thin layer of mortar on the laggings just before the
concrete was put in.</p>

<p>The overhead conductor pockets were a great hindrance to the placing
of the key concrete, especially where the iron was below true grade.
Whenever an especially troublesome one was met, a special grout pipe
was put in to fill up unavoidable holes by grouting after the concrete
had set. All the circumferential reinforcing rods were bent in the
tunnel by bending them around a curved form of less diameter than
the required bend. This generally left them all right in the middle of
their length, but with their end portions too straight; in such cases
the ends were bent again. All rods were compared with a template
before being passed for use.</p>

<p>The arch forms were left up for 48 hours after keying was finished.
Levels taken after striking the forms showed that no appreciable settlement
occurred. An average gang for a 20-ft. length of arch was:</p>

<p><a href="#TABLE_30">Table 30</a> shows the progress attained under various conditions.</p>

<p>Whenever the face of the bench concrete was constructed before the
arch, the latter was built in two separate portions, that is, the bottom
5 ft., or "haunches" of the arch, as they were termed, were built on
each side and the rest of the arch later. This involved the use of two
separate sets of forms, namely, for the haunch and for the arch. Not
very much arch was built in this way, and, as the methods were in
principle precisely the same as those used when all the arch was built
in one operation, no detailed description is needed.</p>

<p>No provision was made in the contract for grouting the concrete
arch, but it soon became evident that by ordinary methods the top
part of the concrete could not be packed solid against the iron segments,
especially in the keys. As it was imperative to have the arch
perfectly solid, it was determined to fill these unavoidable gaps with
a 1:1 Portland cement grout, at the same time making every effort to
reduce the spaces to a minimum. This made it necessary to build
grout pipes into the concrete as it was put in.</p>

<p>The first type of grout pipe arrangement is shown as Type <i>A</i>, in <a href="#Fig_23">Fig. 23</a>.
This was used with the longitudinal key laggings; when this method
was found to be no good, and cross-laggings were used, the system shown
as Type <i>B</i>, in <a href="#Fig_23">Fig. 23</a>, was adopted, in which vents were provided to
let out the air during grouting. The expense of these pipes was high,
and the contractor obtained permission to use sheet-iron tubes, which,
however, were found to be unsuitable, so that the screwed pipes were
used again. The contractor next obtained permission to try dispensing
altogether with the vent pipes, and so Type <i>C</i>, in <a href="#Fig_23">Fig. 23</a> was evolved.
This, of course, was found to be worse than any of the other systems, as
the imprisoned air made it impossible to force grout in. Several other
modifications were made, and are shown in <a href="#Fig_23">Fig. 23</a>.</p>

<p>It was then decided to devise as perfect a system as possible, without
allowing the question of cost to be the ruling factor, and to use that
system throughout. In this system, shown as Type <i>S</i>, in <a href="#Fig_23">Fig. 23</a>, most
of the vent pipes were contained in the concrete, and their size was
independent of the thickness of the arch, so that they were easily fixed
in position and not subject to disturbance while placing the concrete.
This system was used for about 80% of the total length of the tunnel,
and proved entirely satisfactory. The machine used for grouting was the
same as that used for grouting outside the metal lining.</p>

<p>The only compressed air available was the high-pressure supply, at
about 90 lb.; a reducing valve, to lower this pressure to 30 lb. was used
between the air line and the grouting machine. This was thought to
be about as high a pressure as the green concrete arch would stand,
and, even as it was, at one point a section about 2 ft. by 1 ft. was
blown out.</p>

<p>A rough traveling stage resting on the bottom step of the duct
bench concrete was used as a working platform. In the earlier stages
of the work the grouting was carried on in a rather haphazard
manner, but, when the last system of grout and vent pipes was adopted;
the work was undertaken systematically, and was carried out as
follows:</p>

<p>Two 20-ft. lengths of arch were grouted at one time, and, in order
to prevent the grout from flowing along the arch and blocking the pipes
in the next lengths, a bulkhead of plaster was made at the end of
every second length to confine the grout.</p>

<p>After a section had been grouted, test holes were drilled every
50 ft. along the crown to see that all the voids were filled; if not,
holes were drilled in the arch, both for grouting and for vents, and
the faulty section was re-grouted. An average of &frac34; bbl. of cement
and an equal quantity of sand was used per linear foot of tunnel.
The average amount put in by one machine per shift was 15 bbl., and
therefore the average length of tunnel grouted per machine per shift
was 20 ft. The typical working force was:</p>

<p>After the grouting was finished, the arches were rubbed over with
wire brushes to take off discoloration, and rough places at the junctions
of adjoining lengths or left by the block laggings were bush-hammered.

<p><i>Face of Bench Concrete.</i>&mdash;The form used for this portion of the
work is shown on <a href="#PLATE_XLV">Plate XLV</a>. It consisted of a central framework
traveling on wheels, and, from the framework, two vertical forms were
suspended, one on each side, and equal in height to the whole height
of the bench. Adjusting screws were fitted at intervals both at top
and bottom, and thus the position of the face forms could be adjusted
accurately. The face forms were built very carefully of 3-in. tongued
and grooved yellow pine, and one 50-ft. form was used for 3,000 ft. of
tunnel without having the face renewed. Great care was taken to set
these forms true to line and grade, as the appearance of the tunnel
would have been ruined by any irregularity. Joints between successive
lengths were finished with a <b>V</b>-groove.</p>

<p>The concrete was received at the form in dumping buckets; these
were hoisted to the top of the form by a Lidgerwood hoister fixed to a
trailer. The concrete was placed in the form by shoveling it from the
traveling stage down chutes fitted to its side. The quantity of water to
be used in the mixture needed careful regulation. The first few batches
in the bottom had to be very wet, and were made with less stone than
the upper portion, in order that the concrete would pack solidly around
the niche box forms and other awkward corners.</p>

<p>The forms for the ladders and refuge niches were fastened to the
face of the bench forms by bolts which could be loosened before the
main form was moved ahead, and in this way the ladder and niche forms
were left in position for some time after the main form was removed.</p>

<p>At first the forms were kept in place for 36 hours after finishing
a length, but, after a little experience, 24 hours was found to be
enough. In the summer, when the rise of temperature quickened the
set, the time was brought down to 18 hours. The average time taken
for a 50-ft. length was:</p>

<p>After the forms were removed, any rough places at the lower edge,
where the concrete joins the "lip," were bush-hammered; no other
cleaning work was done.</p>

<p><i>Duct Laying and Rodding.</i>&mdash;The design and location of the ducts
have already been described. It will have been seen that the duct-bench
concrete was laid in steps, on which the ducts were laid, hence
the maintenance of the grade and line in the ducts was an easy
matter. The only complication was the expanded metal bonds, which
were bent up out of the way of the arch forms and straightened out
again after the arch forms had passed. The materials, such as ducts,
sand, and cement, were brought into the tunnel by the regular transportation
gang. The mortar was mixed in a wooden trough about
10 ft. long, 2 ft. 6 in. wide and 8 in. deep.</p>

<p>After the single-way ducts had been laid, all the joints were
plastered with mortar, in order to prevent any foreign substance from
entering the ducts. This was not necessary with the multiple duct, as
the joints were wrapped with cotton duck. The ducts were laid on a
laying mandrel, and, as soon as possible after the concrete was laid
around a set of ducts, they were "rodded" with a rodding mandrel.
Not many obstructions were met, and these were usually some stray
laying mandrel which had been left in by mistake, or collections of
mortar where the plastering of the single-way joints had been defective.</p>

<p>In the 657,000 duct ft. of conduit in the river tunnels only eight
serious obstructions were met. That the work was of exceptionally
high quality is shown by the fact that a heavy 3-in. lead cable has been
passed through from manhole to manhole (450 ft.) in 6 min., and the
company, engaged to lay the cables in these ducts, broke all its previous
records for laying, not only for tunnel work, but also in the open.</p>

<p><a href="#PLATE_XXXV_Fig_1">Fig. 1, Plate XXXV</a>, shows a collection
of the tools and arrangements used in laying and rodding ducts. The typical
working force was:</p>

<p>No detailed description need be given of the concreting of the
cross-passages, pump chambers, sumps, and other small details, the
design of which has been previously shown. The concrete was finished
on June 1st, 1909.</p>

<p><i>Period No. 6.</i>&mdash;<i>Final Cleaning Up.</i>&mdash;<i>June, 1909, to November,
1909.</i>&mdash;As soon as all the concrete was finished, the work of cleaning up
the invert was begun. A large quantity of d&eacute;bris littered the tunnels,
and it was economical to remove it as quickly as possible. The remaining
forms were first removed, and hoisting engines, supported on cross-timber
laid across the benches, were set up in the middle of the
tunnel at about 500-ft. intervals.</p>

<p>Work was carried on day and night, and about 169 ft. of single
tunnel was cleared per 10-hour shift. Work was begun on May 28th,
and finished on July 15th, 1909. For part of the time it was carried
on at two points in each tunnel, working toward the two shafts, but
when the work in the Weehawken Shaft, which was being done at the
same time, blocked egress from that point, all material was sent out by
the Manhattan Shaft.</p>

<p>The total quantity of material removed was 5,350 cu. yd., or about
0.44 cu. yd. per lin. ft. of tunnel. The average force per shift was:</p>

<p>After the cleaning out had been done, the contractor's main work
was finished. However, quite a considerable force was employed, up
to November, 1909, in doing various incidental jobs, such as the installation
of permanent ventilation conduits and nozzles at the intercepting
arch near the Manhattan Shaft, the erection of a head-house
over the Manhattan Shaft, and collecting and putting in order
all the miscellaneous portable plant, which was either sold or returned
to store, sorting all waste materials, such as lumber, piping,
and scraps of all kinds, and, in general, restoring the sites of the
working yards to their original condition.</p>

<h3>Concrete Mixing.</h3>

<p>The plant used in mixing the concrete for the land tunnels was
pulled down and re-erected before the concrete work in the river
tunnels was begun. At the New York shaft two new bins for sand
and stone were built, bringing the total capacity up to 950 cu. yd.
Two No. 6 Ransome mixers, driven electrically by 30-h.p. General
Electric motors, using current from the contractor's generators, were
set up on a special platform in the intercepting arch.</p>

<p>At Manhattan the sand and stone were received from the bins in
chutes at a small hopper built on the permanent upper platform of
the intercepting arch. Bottom-dumping cars, divided by a partition
into two portions, arranged to hold the proper quantities of sand and
stone for a 4-bag batch of concrete, were run on a track on this upper
platform, filled with the proper quantities of sand and stone, and
then run back and dumped into the hoppers of the mixer. After
mixing, the batch was run down chutes into the tunnel cars standing
on the track below. The water was brought in pipes from the
public supply. It was measured in barrels by a graduated scale within
the barrels. The water was not put into the mixer until the sand
and stone had all run out of the mixer hopper. The mixture was
revolved for about 1&frac12; min., or about 20 complete revolutions.</p>

<p>At Weehawken Shaft the mixing plant was entirely rebuilt. Four

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span>

large bins, two for sand and two for stone, were built in the shaft.
Together, they held 430 cu. yd. of stone and 400 cu. yd. of sand.
The sand and stone were dumped directly into the bins from the cars
on the trestle which ran from the wharf to the shaft. The materials
were run through chutes directly from the bins to the hoppers
of the mixers, where they were measured. Two No. 6 Ransome
mixers, electrically driven, were used here, as at New York, and,
as there, the water was led into measuring tanks before being let
into the mixer.</p>

<p>The quantity of water used in the various parts of the concrete
cross-section, for a 4-bag batch consisting of 1 bbl. (380 lb.) of
cement, 8.75 cu. ft. of sand, and 17.5 cu. ft. of stone, is given in

<p>The sand used was practically the same for the whole of the river
tunnel section, and was supposed to be equal to "Cow Bay" sand. The
result of the mechanical analysis of the sand is shown on<a href="#PLATE_XLVI"> Plate XLVI</a>.
The stone was all trap rock. For the early part of the work it consisted
of stone which would pass a 2-in. ring and be retained on a 1&frac12;-in. ring,
in fact, the same as used for the land tunnels. This was found to
be too coarse, and for a time it was mixed with an equal quantity of
fine gravel or fine crushed stone. As soon as it could be arranged, run-of-crusher
stone was used, everything larger than 2&frac12; in. being excluded.
About three-quarters of the river tunnel concrete was put in with
run-of-crusher stone. The force was:</p>

<p>The average quantity of concrete mixed per 10-hour shift was about
117 batches, or about 90 cu. yd. The maximum output of one of the
mixers was about 168 batches, or 129 cu. yd. per 10-hour shift.</p>

<h3>Transportation.</h3>

<p><i>Surface Transportation.</i>&mdash;At Manhattan the stone and sand were
received in scows at the wharf on the river front. For the first part
of the work, the wharf at 32d Street and North River was used, and
while that was in use the material was unloaded from the scows into
scale-boxes by a grab-bucket running on an overhead cable, and then
teamed to the shaft. For the latter part of the work, the wharf used
was at 38th Street and North River, where facilities for unloading
were given to the contractor by the Pennsylvania Railroad Company
which was the permanent lessee of the piers. The material was unloaded
into scale-boxes by a grab-bucket operated by a derrick, and
teamed to the shaft. When the scale-boxes arrived at the shaft they
were lifted from the trucks by derricks and dumped into the bins.

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</a></span></p>

<p>At Weehawken all the stone and sand, with the exception of the
stone crushed on the work, was received by water at the North slip.
Here it was unloaded by a 2-cu. yd. grab-bucket and dumped into
3-cu. yd. side-tipping cars, which were hauled by a small steam locomotive
over the trestle to the shaft, where they were dumped directly
into the bins.</p>

<p>Before beginning the concrete lining, the 2-ft. gauge railway, which
had been used for the surface transportation during the driving of the
iron-lined tunnels, was taken up and replaced by a 3-ft. gauge track
consisting largely of 30-lb. rails. The cars were 3-cu. yd. side-dumping,
with automatic swinging sides. Two steam locomotives which were
being stored at Weehawken (part of the plant from another contract),
were used for hauling the cars in place of the electric ones used with
the 2-ft. gauge railway.</p>

<p><i>Tunnel Transport.</i>&mdash;The track used in the tunnel was of 2-ft.
gauge, laid with the 20-lb. rails previously used in driving the iron-lined
tunnels. The mining cars (previously mentioned in describing
the driving of the iron-lined tunnels) were used for transporting the
invert concrete, although, for most of the work, dumping buckets carried
on flat cars were used. Several haulage systems were considered
for this work, but not one of them was thought to be flexible enough
to be used with the constantly changing conditions, and it was eventually
decided to move all the cars by hand, because, practically all
the work being down grade, the full cars could be run down by gravity
and the empty ones pushed back by hand. Two men were allotted to
each car, and were able to keep the traffic moving in a manner that
would have been perhaps impossible with any system of mechanical
haulage. This system was apparently justified by the results, for the
whole cost of the tunnel transport, over an average haul of about
2,000 ft., was only about 50 cents per cu. yd., which will be found to
compare favorably with mechanical haulage on similar work elsewhere,
provided full allowance is made for the use of the plant and power.</p>

<p><i>Force Employed.</i>&mdash;The average force employed on transport, both
on the surface and in the tunnel, is shown in <a href="#TABLE_33">Table 33</a>.</p>

<h3>Costs.</h3>

<p>During the work, careful records of the actual cost to the contractor
of carrying out this work were kept by the Company's forces; these
costs include all direct charges, such as labor and materials, and all
indirect charges such as head office, plant depreciation, insurance, etc.,
but do not include the cost of any financing, of which the Company
had no information.</p>

<h3>Field Engineering Staff.</h3>

<p>The field staff may be considered as divisible into five main divisions:</p>

<p>(<i>A</i>).&mdash;Construction, including alignment,<br />
<br />
(<i>B</i>).&mdash;Cost records,<br />
<br />
(<i>C</i>).&mdash;Testing of cement and other materials of construction,<br />
<br />
(<i>D</i>).&mdash;Photography,<br />
<br />
(<i>E</i>).&mdash;Despatch-boat service.<br /></p>

<p>(<i>A</i>).&mdash;<i>Construction</i>(<i>Inspection and Alignment</i>) <i>Staff.</i>&mdash;A comparatively
large staff was maintained by the Company, and to this
two causes contributed. In the first place, the contractor maintained
no field engineering staff, because, early in the proceedings, it was
arranged that the Company would carry out all this work, and thus
avoid the overlapping, confusion, and lack of definite responsibility
which often ensues when two engineering forces are working over the
same ground. Even had the contractor maintained an engineering
force, it would have been necessary for the Company to check most
of the contractor's work.</p>

<p>In the second place, this work gave rise to a number of special
surveys, tests, borings, and observations of various kinds, most of which
were kept up as a part of the regular routine work, and this necessitated

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</a></span>

a staff. Also, for a whole year, active progressive work was
at a standstill while the pile tests were going on.</p>

<p>(<i>B</i>).&mdash;<i>Cost Records Staff.</i>&mdash;A distinct feature was made of keeping
as accurately as possible detailed records of the actual cost to the
contractor of carrying out the work. A small staff of clerks, retained
solely for this purpose, tabulated and recorded the information furnished
by the members of the construction staff. About $12,000, altogether,
was spent in salaries in this department, and it may be considered
an extremely wise investment, for, not only is the information
thus obtained of great value and interest in itself, but it also puts the
Company in an excellent position should any claim or discussion arise
with the contractor.</p>

<p>(<i>C</i>).&mdash;<i>Cement-Testing Department.</i>&mdash;As the Company furnished
the cement to the contractor, it became incumbent to make careful tests
of the quality. A cement-testing laboratory was established at the
Manhattan Shaft offices, under the charge of a cement inspector who
was furnished with assistants for sampling, shipping, and testing
cement. All materials used on the work, such as bricks, sand, stone,
water-proofing, etc., were tested here, with the exception of metals,
which were under the charge of a metal inspector reporting directly to
the head office. This department cost about $10,000 for salaries and
$3,000 for apparatus and supplies, or about $13,000, in all.</p>

<p>There were 800,000 bbl. of cement tested, and samples from 2,100,000
brick. A large amount of useful information has resulted from the
work of this laboratory.</p>

<p>(<i>D</i>).&mdash;<i>Photography.</i>&mdash;It was desired to keep a complete photographic
record of the progress of the work, and therefore a photographer was
appointed, with office room at the Manhattan Shaft. The photographer
took all the progress photographs on the work of the North River
Division, made photographic reductions of all drawings and plans,
made lantern slides of all negatives of a more important nature, and,
in addition, during the period of compressed air, analyzed the samples
of compressed air, brought into the office for the purpose, for the
amount of CO<sub>2</sub> present. About $8,000 was spent on this department.</p>

<p>(<i>E</i>).&mdash;<i>Despatch-Boat Service.</i>&mdash;To provide access to the New Jersey
side, a despatch boat was purchased. This boat was at first (June,
1904) chartered, and in May, 1905, was bought outright, and ran on
regular schedules, day and night. It continued in the service until

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</a></span>

April, 1909, when it was given up, as the tunnels were so far completed
that they provided easy access to New Jersey. The cost of the
boat (second-hand) was about $3,000. It was then thoroughly overhauled
and the cabin remodeled. The monthly cost, when working
a 12-hour shift, was $270 for manning, $65 for supplies, and $64 for
coal. On two 12-hour shifts, the monthly cost was $533 for manning,
$100 for supplies, and $96 for coal. About 100,000 passengers were
carried during the boat's period of service, and the total cost was
about $37,500.</p>

<p>For the major part of the period embraced by this paper, B. H. M.
Hewett, M. Am. Soc. C. E., served as General Resident Engineer, in
charge of the Field Work as a whole.</p>

<p>W. L. Brown, M. Am. Soc. C. E., was at first Resident Engineer of
the work constructed from the Manhattan Shaft, while H. F. D. Burke,
M. Am. Soc. C. E., was Resident Engineer of the work constructed from
the Weehawken Shaft. After the meeting of the shields, Mr. Burke left
to take up another appointment, and from that time Mr. Brown acted as
Resident Engineer.</p>

<p>It may be said, without reflecting in any way on the manufacturers,
that the high standard of all the metal materials also testified to the
efficient inspection conducted under the direction of Mr. J. C. Naegeley.</p>

<p>It is impossible to close this brief account of these tunnels without
recording the invaluable services at all times rendered by the members
of the Company's field staff. Where all worked with one common aim
it might seem invidious to single out names, but special credit is due
to the following Assistant Engineers: Messrs. H. E. Boardman, Assoc.
M. Am. Soc. C. E., W. H. Lyon, H. U. Hitchcock, E. R. Peckens, H. J.
Wild, Assoc. M. Am. Soc. C. E., J. F. Sullivan, Assoc. M. Am. Soc. C.
E., and R. T. Robinson, Assoc. M. Am. Soc. C. E. Mr. C. E. Price was
in charge of the cement tests throughout the entire period, and brought
to his work not only ability but enthusiasm. Mr. H. D. Bastow was in
charge of the photographic work, and Mr. A. L. Heyer of the cost
account records, in which he was ably seconded by Mr. A. P. Gehling,
who, after Mr. Heyer's departure, finished the records and brought
them into their final shape. The organization of the Company's field
engineering staff is shown graphically by <a name="Fig_24" id="Fig_24"></a>
